<p>Hi Rosie, these are the quantities Doug took off last week, which I thought you might find useful.&nbsp; All machined sections are ex 25 or 50mm sections by 50/75/100/150/175/200mm, and assumed fully seasoned.&nbsp; Where sawn finish it is generally a fine one.</p>
<p>If you want any more advice on this, please get back to me.</p>
<p>Best</p>
<p>Bryan</p>
<p>Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen IT4 cladding ex 25 x 150mm with two sawn long faces (must be reversible so we can hide any sapwood) – 235/5.0m&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried saw fallen 16 x 89mm v-jointed t&amp;g with two sawn faces - 29m²&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen 75 x75mm with four sawn faces – 4/4.0m&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen 45 x95mm with four sawn faces – 34/4.0m&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen 45 x40mm weathered/angled, as attached, with four sawn faces – 230/5.0m&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen grooved decking 45 x 95mm – 70/5.0m&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen dressed 45 x 145mm – 16/4.8m&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen dressed 45 x 170mm – 10/4.0m&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen dressed 45 x 45mm – 10/4.8m&nbsp; Siberian larch kiln dried sawnfallen 22 x 195mm with two sawn long faces – 24/5.0m</p>

<p>Hi Brock, further to&nbsp;your enquiry, pricelist/specification plus a pdf for our Model E attached, and more detailed drawings of our standard designs than on our website on links below.&nbsp; The Model E has no rain screening, decking or roof overhangs, and while there are reduced roof overhangs as standard, this is now quoted as an extra on the Model D price list (except for a 1.7m deep gable deck, which is included at the extended roof overhang).</p>
<p>The Indicative Total Cost does not include any allowance for a main contractor or project manager, as many of our customers do this themselves as self-builders.&nbsp; We are well placed to provide support in doing this and in providing or facilitating provision of all the paperwork required in getting to that stage, which makes for a very cost-effective package, but we can provide a full-build service if that is sought.&nbsp; Local “other trades” contractors are usually accustomed to working together and co-ordinating what they do, which can help greatly with running a house-build.&nbsp; A turn-key supply adds substantially to cost as it requires a main contractor and project manager.&nbsp; We can usually provide a project manager if required or supply through a main contractor (subject to agreed payment terms).</p>
<p>Cost will vary depending on site location, access and site conditions, but the Indicative Total Cost gives good guidance of the direct build costs.&nbsp; We frequently carry out the erection of the finished shell, i.e.&nbsp;the house having roof finish, guttering and wall cladding completed, and the standing scaffolding removed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Alternatively, we can erect the shell only to airtightness level.&nbsp; The airtightness membrane is installed as part of this process, and the only specialist issue thereafter is ensuring it is not pierced, or where this is necessary, that this is supervised and adequately sealed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kit price includes all drawings, schedules, calculations and certification etc relating to our supply, and we are happy to provide a kit only, although if we are not providing any erection labour we would have to charge VAT on it, which is normally reclaimable for a dwelling-house.&nbsp; Similarly on that basis, we normally don’t have to charge VAT if we provide some assistance with the kit erection.</p>
<p>Regarding mortgageablity, the construction is compliant with the criteria of most lenders, the only exception in our experience to date is the few who won’t lend on timber clad homes.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are category A1 NHBC housebuilders, and can carry out construction under their ten-year warranty scheme, which includes staged inspections during the build.</p>
<p>We’ll be pleased to provide any additional information you may require, and to discuss the project further with you.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

<p>I’ll be back in the office later, and will email you our information pack which includes guide prices, but it has been very difficult to keep track of material prices this year. &nbsp;I’ll also send you a specimen quotation which sets out our normal contract terms. &nbsp;In the past we have been able to confirm the kit cost on order confirmation (which is the next stage for you following receipt of the BW), but recently all we could do was have up to date quotes for most of the required materials, then order these promptly, and identify those where this was not possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We regularly help folk fill in their mortgage application forms in regard to costs and how these are set out. &nbsp;Where there is a mortgage we usually provide NHBC cover, which gives a 10 year warranty, and independent, staged inspections, otherwise you are likely to need to have the build stages inspected and certified by a chartered professional. &nbsp;The cost of NHBC cover is usually around £2,000. &nbsp;The self-build lenders we have mainly come across are Halifax and &nbsp;the Ecological Building Society.</p>
<p>The BW requires structural design certification of the whole house, including the full design of the substructure, which allows accurate estimates to be obtained for that. &nbsp;We can provide cost allowances for other trades, but the harder the information, i.e.&nbsp;actual estimates, the better. &nbsp;Again, the BW specifies these fairly tightly. &nbsp;You also need a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery (MVHR) installation due to the airtightness, and a local firm has done almost all of these in our most recent houses. &nbsp;Additionally, you may need to firm up on the renewables input and heating. &nbsp;This will all have been done in draft form to produce SAP calculations for the BW, but you may want to give it further thought.</p>
<p>Our current lead time from order confirmation to kit deliver to site is about 14 weeks. &nbsp;While we have had pre Christmas notifications of further complement price increases, I think timber prices may well soften in the New Year (they have doubled over the past 18 months!). &nbsp; Concrete, and especially steel prices have shot up, along with there being supply issues, but we have costs on a current local groundworks and substructure build at Chapel of Garioch, which should be a good guide for starters. &nbsp;From commencement of site works to completion usually takes about six months. &nbsp;Trades overlaps add time, and that between practical completion and actual occupation alway seems to take longer than what folk plan!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Even the simplest planning application will take six weeks to process, probably longer.&nbsp; I think the main reason they are asking for this is to ensure the neighbour has been notified.</p>
<p>In terms of kit delivery, the critical supply time is normally for the windows and external doors.&nbsp; This is currently about 12 weeks plus with all the usual suppliers, and another three weeks can be added to that for their July shutdown.&nbsp; We don’t like to order these until the BW is issued, or at least it has been confirmed there are definitely no issues regarding the building regulations.&nbsp; It would also be good to know there was no issue with the planning application to reorientate the house.&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>Also a good move to get the extant consent confirmed as implemented, as set out by Doug.</p>
<p>An August delivery for the kit looks more likely.&nbsp; The paperwork is a marathon these days, so actually erecting the houses seems a bit of a breeze by comparison!</p>
