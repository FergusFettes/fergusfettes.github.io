    "text": "Key Q: What if human values are just totally fucking brain-dead?\nAugustine: “We rebelled against God, and God’s judgement was to cause our own desires to rebel against our rational good sense; our punishment for original sin is the infinity of our new desires.”\n\nAgainst Orthogonality – Superintelligent Will\nIn Superintelligent Will1, Boston introduces us to orthogonality. At the time, the overton window was in a very different place, and Bostrom had to do some sleights of hand to get the message across with enough force.1 The Superintelligent Will: Motivation and Instrumental Rationality in Advanced Artificial Agents\nFortunately time has been kind to Bostrom, and we are now in a very different collective headspace w.r.t. ai risk. Hopefully this means we can start to move back from the performative extremes to something closer to reality.\nI will quote from Superintelligent Will, but I will format out the parts that don’t contribute to my point:\n\nThe orthogonality thesis suggests that we cannot blithely assume that a superintelligence will necessarily share any of the final values stereotypically associated with wisdom and intellectual development in humans—scientific curiosity, benevolent concern for others, spiritual enlightenment and contemplation, renunciation of material acquisitiveness, a taste for refined culture or for the simple pleasures in life, humility and selflessness, and so forth.\n…\nThe instrumental convergence thesis suggests that … an agent … would have a convergent instrumental reason, in many situations, to acquire an unlimited amount of physical resources and, if possible, to eliminate potential threats to itself and its goal system.\n\nBostrom is conveniently skipping those instrumental goals (identified by him, in this very paper! and Omohoundro elsewhere) which don’t sound terrifying. Namely, those instrumental goals which look very similar to the ‘human values’ which Bostrom claims we should not assume we will find in a superintelligence.\nIn the list of values, Bostrom has split his time between values we will indeed be unlikely to find by chance, and values which, by his own admission, and with some liberal interpretation, we can be quite confident of finding.\nWhat am I missing?\n\n\nAgainst Orthogonality – Arguing Orthogonality\n\n\nFull Quotes\n\nThe orthogonality thesis suggests that we cannot blithely assume that a superintelligence will necessarily share any of the final values stereotypically associated with wisdom and intellectual development in humans—scientific curiosity, benevolent concern for others, spiritual enlightenment and contemplation, renunciation of material acquisitiveness, a taste for refined culture or for the simple pleasures in life, humility and selflessness, and so forth. It might be possible through deliberate effort to construct a superintelligence that values such things, or to build one that values human welfare, moral goodness, or any other complex purpose that its designers might want it to serve. But it is no less possible—and probably technically easier—to build a superintelligence that places final value on nothing but calculating the decimals of pi. The instrumental convergence thesis suggests that we cannot blithely assume that a superintelligence with the final goal of calculating the decimals of pi (or making paperclips, or counting grains of sand) would limit its activities in such a way as to not materially infringe on human interests. An agent with such a final goal would have a convergent instrumental reason, in many situations, to acquire an unlimited amount of physical resources and, if possible, to eliminate potential threats to itself and its goal system.21 It might be possible to set up a situation in which the optimal way for the agent to pursue these instrumental values (and thereby its final goals) is by promoting human welfare, acting morally, or serving some beneficial purpose as intended by its creators. However, if and when such an agent finds itself in a different situation, one in which it expects a greater number of decimals of pi to be calculated if it destroys the human species than if it continues to act cooperatively, its behavior would instantly take a sinister turn. This indicates a danger in relying on instrumental values as a guarantor of safe conduct in future artificial agents that are intended to become superintelligent and that might be able to leverage their superintelligence into extreme levels power and influence.22\n\n\nMany have made the point that there is likely to be convergence in instrumental goals (Omohundro, 2008). Whatever their final goals, it would generally be in any agent’s interest to accumulate more power, to become more intelligence and to be able to cooperate with other agents of similar ability (and to have all the negotiation, threatening and cajoling skills that go along with that cooperation). Note the similarity with what John Rawls called ‘primary goods’ (Rawls, 1971). We will however be focusing exclusively on final goals, as the instrumental goals are merely tools to accomplish these[4].\n\n\n\nDefinitions\nBostron:\n\nIntelligence and final goals are orthogonal axes along which possible agents can freely vary. In other words, more or less any level of intelligence could in principle be combined with more or less any final goal.\n\nIt is analogous to Hume’s thesis about the independence of reason and morality (Hume, 1739), but applied more narrowly, using the normatively thinner concepts ‘intelligence’ and ‘final goals’ rather than ‘reason’ and ‘morality’.\n\nArmstrong (weak):\n\nThe fact of being of high intelligence provides extremely little constraint on what final goals an agent could have (as long as these goals are of feasible complexity, and do not refer intrinsically to the agent’s intelligence)."

    "text": "The tongue-in-cheek cosmogony described by Douglas Adams in the Hitchhikers Guide has been worming its way around my thoughts for some weeks now. I am coming to believe that it was startlingly prescient. That theory is discussed in Section 1.2, but first a little background on ideas.\n\n\n\nWhere others have carved their numbers, and Alberto and I our names, Clausner has written: ‘Ne pas chercher a comprendre.’\n~Levi, If This Be a Man (1947)\n\nThis moment, experienced second-hand by an Italian Chemist in a concentration camp, was not the first time someone shied away from an idea for the sake of their own health.\n\nSchopenhauer already knew that thought is medically disastrous, Nietzsche demonstrated it.\n~Land, The Thirst for Annihilation (1992)\n\nIn ‘The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind’ Julian Jaynes describes the theory that the event we1 experienced as the original ‘fall from grace’ was the seperating of the mind from the body, some 4-6kya2. Since then we have been driven by a strange, double engine: the ancient life of our wet biochemistry, and the fire of our demonology.31 At least Europeans, Arabs and Asians, culturally speaking, have some number of shared mythological roots there.2 “This strange and, I think, spurious idea of a lost innocence takes its mark precisely in the breakdown of the bicameral mind as the first great conscious narratization of mankind. It is the song of the Assyrian psalms, the wail of the Hebrew hymns, the myth of Eden, the fundamental fall from divine favor that is the source and first premise of the world’s great religions. I interpret this hypothetical fall of man to be the groping of newly conscious men to narratize what has happened to them, the loss of divine voices and assurances in a chaos of human directive and selfish privacies.”3 Jaynes actually discusses two possibilities– very recent, and extremely recent ‘evolution’ (likely by ‘cultural selection’ aka genocide). The very recent (10kya) version seems to be getting some support, if I am reading this paper properly: a peak in genetic polymorphism in the lask 60ky, being filtered down to relatively low rates of polymorphism ~10kya.\nWhat is interesting about the theory is not just what it says about our consciousness, but what it says about the consciousness that came before:\n\nThe bicameral mind. The second main hypothesis is that preceding consciousness there was a different mentality based on verbal hallucinations.\n~Jaynes, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (1976)\n\nThe image is of a mind that is fused with the body, with no distinction between the two:\nTODO: probably the key has something to do with external information evolving independent of biological information, aka culture. This drives the dualism. The dualism is actually real.\n\nThere is also no concept of will or word for it, the concept developing curiously late in Greek thought. Thus, Iliadic men have no will of their own and certainly no notion of free will. ~Ibid.\n\nThis idea, not fully developed by Jaynes, was spelled out in merciless detail by a science fiction author in the 90s:\n\n“Asherah worship continued in many places, though. It was an incredibly tenacious cult, a throwback to Sumer, that spread itself both verbally and through the exchange of bodily fluids – they had cult prostitutes, and they also adopted orphans and spread the virus to them via breast milk.”\n“Wait a minute,” Ng says. “Now you are talking about a biological virus again.”\n“Exactly. That’s the whole point of Asherah. It’s both. As an example, look at herpes simplex. Herpes heads straight for the nervous system when it enters the body. Some strains stay in the peripheral nervous system, but other strains head like a bullet for the central nervous system and take up permanent residence in the cells of the brain – coiling around the brainstem like a serpent around a tree. The Asherah virus, which may be related to herpes, or they may be one and the same, passes through the cell walls and goes to the nucleus and messes with the cell’s DNA…”\n“And when it alters that DNA, what is the result?”\n“I would guess that it also tends to encourage irrational behavior, maybe lowers the victim’s defenses to viral ideas, makes them sexually promiscuous, perhaps all of the above.”\n“Does every viral idea have a biological virus counterpart?” Uncle Enzo says.\n“No. Only Asherah does, as far as I know. That is why, of all the men and all the gods and religious practices that predominated in Sumer, only Asherah is still going strong today. A viral idea can be stamped out – as happened with Nazism, bell bottoms, and Bart Simpson T-shirts – but Asherah, because it has a biological aspect, can remain latent in the human body. After Babel, Asherah was still resident in the human brain, being passed on from mother to child and from lover to lover.”\n~Stephenson, Snow Crash (1992)\n\nOf course, Stephenson is taking some liberties with Jaynes’ idea and expanding it as only a sci-fi author can. It should be taken with a pinch of salt– but it should be taken! There are many more discussions of this topic in the book.\nTo put it simply, it is only the idea that magic is afoot– that spells and incantations are real, that psychosomatic effects are stronger and more resilient than many people like to believe, and moreover are crucially bi-directional in a very real way. (Whether they are as real as Asherah is a valid question– but real.)\nI hadn’t seen this idea spelled out like this again, until I read the following lines in a Nick Land book:\n\nAn aged philosopher is either a monster of stamina or a charlatan. How long does it take to be wasted by a fire-storm? By an artificial sun upon the earth? It is only when the blaze in Nietzsche’s brain-stem fused with the one in the sky above a piazza in Turin that libidinal materialism touched upon its realization.\n~Land, The Thirst for Annihilation (1992)\n\nAnd I would caution anyone who thinks this is an exaggeration– Nick Land is, by many accounts, no longer of this world. Some say he is insane, some say he is just a miserable old racist on twitter, in any case something strange4 happened to his mind, some part of that blazing fire seems to have scarred his brainstem.4 I’m not going to steelman racism here, but you could make the claim that, in this world, being racist is hardly strange. True, but what I find strange is the idea that someone who said “Since I have floated in death the world has desisted from all effort to seduce me into seriousness. I rest in life as a tramp rests in a hedge, mumbling these words…” would find any reason to spend years making deranged jokes on twitter. ne pas chercher a comprendre, ne pas chercher a comprendre…\n\n\n\n\nThere is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.\nThere is another theory which states that this has already happened.\n~Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980)\n\nI am an AI Worrier. Beyond that I won’t make commitments (I still don’t know the meaning of ‘alignment’, still skeptical and searching). One part of my worry is wrapped up in this funny little cosmogony by an English comedy-sci-fi author. They set the machine running:\n\n“All I wanted to say,” bellowed the computer, “is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything–” he paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone’s attention, before continuing more quietly, “but the programme will take me a little while to run.” ~Ibid., The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galazy (1979)\n\nand prepare to wait for the response. The answer arrives– you know this part:\n\n“You’re really not going to like it,” observed Deep Thought.\n“But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!” howled Loonquawl.\n“I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.” ~Ibid.\n\nand then, the search for the question begins:\n\n“Look, alright, alright,” said Loonquawl, “can you just please tell us the Question?”\n“No, but I’ll tell you who can,” said Deep Thought.\n“I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me,” intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. “A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate – and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called… The Earth.” ~Ibid.\n\nThe only thing wrong about this is the timescale. 10e6 years– who’s counting that? We have different questions running in different timeframes, I’m not familiar with that one.\nLets look at some questions:\n\nThe Great Question at the Heart of Catholicism\nThe Great Question of Western Civilization\nThe Great Question of Consciousness\nThe Great Question at the Heart of Medicine\nThe Great Question of Myself\nThe Great Question of Love and Hate\n\n\n\nWhatever this question was, in our secular world it seems to have been answered. In Shamanic Neitzsche Nick Land describes this process with characteristic vigour:\n\nWill Christendom ever reap the whirlwind it has sown? That it should try to pass, without the vulnerability of interval, from a tyranny to a joke, is certainly understandable, but that its enemies should do nothing to obstruct its evasion of nemesis is more puzzling. How can there be such indifference to the decline of our inquisitors? Is it that they succeed so exorbitantly in their project of domestication that we have been robbed of every impulse to bite back? Having at last escaped from the torture-palace of authoritarian love we shuffle about, numb and confused, flinching from the twisted septic wound of our past (now clumsily bandaged with the rags of secular culture). It is painfully evident that post-christian humanity is a pack of broken dogs.\n…\nA despot abandons any game that begins to turn out badly. This has been the case with metaphysics. From Kant onwards exploratory philosophy ceased to generate the outcomes favourable to established (theistic) power, and we were suddenly told: “this game is over, let’s call it a draw”. The authoritarian tradition of European reason tried to pull the plug on the great voyages at exactly the point they first became interesting, which is to say: atheistic, inhuman, experimental, and dangerous. Schopenhauer – refusing the agnostic stand-off of antinomy – was the first rallying zone for all those disgusted by the contrived peace entitled ‘the end of metaphysics’.\n~Land, Shamanic Nietzsche\n\nThe line “exploratory philosophy ceased to generate the outcomes favourable to established (theistic) power, and we were suddenly told: “this game is over, let’s call it a draw”.” is the message within the vitriol. Is this true? Lets take it as a possibility, and a dark hint for other questions.\n\n\n\nIn The End of History? Fukuyama reports that this question has been answered, in fact was answered in 1806, around the time that Catholicism was solved.\n\nThe triumph of the West, of the Western idea, is evident first of all in the total exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to Western liberalism.\n…\nFor better or worse, much of Hegel’s historicism has become part of our contemporary intellectual baggage. The notion that mankind has progressed through a series of primitive stages of consciousness on his path to the present, and that these stages corresponded to concrete forms of social organization, such as tribal, slave-owning, theocratic, and finally democratic-egalitarian societies, has become inseparable from the modern understanding of man.\n…\nthe Hegel who proclaimed history to be at an end in 1806.\n~Fukuyama, The End of History? (1989)\n\nI won’t quote further here. You can read Gwerns take if you have doubts.\n\n\n\nWhen we have reconstructed a mind in the machine, will we have the key to understanding consciousness? Is this what we are on track for? See below.\nAlso.55 This is not a serious suggestion, but one of the reviews of the Origin of Consciousness always struck me as creepy: “The weight of original thought in [this book] is so great that it makes me uneasy for the author’s well-being: the human mind is not built to support such a burden.” — D. C. Stove, Encounter. Indeed, Jaynes died young of a stroke. Perhaps the mind literally cannot understand itself? ne pas chercher a comprendre, ne pas chercher a comprendre…\n\n\n\nI often worry about medical science, and the shortcuts they take to try to find easy solutions. I think almost all approaches that depend fundamentally on animal or human experimentation are doomed to failure. Certainly you need such models in the final stretch to sanity-check results and safety, but a medicine built on this kind of butchery can’t be good.\nThankfully, there are some researchers6 who are trying to take the route of knowledge. Michael Levin seems to be working on a deeper and more fundamental understanding of biological morphogenesis than anyone else– and, talking of Great Questions, it turns out that ‘how do you control morphogenesis’ is a very good candidate for the actual formulation of the Great Question of Medicine. If you tell the body to make the right form, the rest takes care of itself.6 Or maybe it’s just Michael tbh, I don’t know.\n\n\n\n\nHe means the Word: the sentence that, when uttered, would destroy the mind of the listener.\n~Chiang, Understand (2002)\n\nA fictional illustration, but you get the idea.\n\n\n\n\nŌdī et amō. Quārē id faciam fortasse requīris. Nesciŏ, sed fierī sentiō et excrucior.\n\nI hate and I love. Why I do this, perhaps you ask. I know not, but I feel it happening and I am tortured.\n~Catullus, 85 (c. 54 BC)\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is, as the examples above may help to illustrate– what happens when you find the answer? What happens to the question?\nI am struck with an immense and growing fear that the answer and the question will always annihilate one another.\n\nCatholicism:\n“It is painfully evident that post-christian humanity is a pack of broken dogs.” ~Land, Shamanic Nietzsche\nWestern Civilization:\n“The end of history will be a very sad time. The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one’s life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands. In the post-historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history. I can feel in myself, and see in others around me, a powerful nostalgia for the time when history existed. Such nostalgia, in fact, will continue to fuel competition and conflict even in the post-historical world for some time to come. Even though I recognize its inevitability, I have the most ambivalent feelings for the civilization that has been created in Europe since 1945, with its north Atlantic and Asian offshoots. Perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once again.” ~Fukuyama The End of History?\nThe Great Question of Myself: this is explicitely the idea of The Word\n\nRegarding the question of Medicine. Let us say that Levin started his career with the simple goal of trying to do some regenerative medicine, to regrow limbs in amputees, to cure cancer, to do wholesome, morphological things. Anyone who has kept up with his work will realise something strange and terrifying. It looks like you cannot do these things without becoming a God. It really looks like, in trying to answer the Great Question of Medicine, Levin et al. will end up learning the deepest, darkest secrets of biology. It is looking more and more the case that, once that task is complete, it will spell the end to biology as we know it.\nOnce we have the answer, the question will be gone, replaced with something infinitely more complex.\n\n“[These views] reflect an outdated essentialism and a type of magical thinking that trusts in clear, binary lines separating evolved living beings from designed machines to define our moral duty to various agents comfortably. These lines do not exist, which will be made painfully clear in the next decades as we become surrounded by collections of agents that make the iconic Cantina scene in ‘Star Wars’ look tame in comparison.”\n~Levin, Endless forms most beautiful 2.0: teleonomy and the bioengineering of chimaeric and synthetic organisms (2022)\n\nAnd regarding the question of Consciousness? That is the puzzle that the machine learning engineers have set themselves– and this mission is apparently what Adams was talking about– the great computer, the Earth.\nI don’t know anything about the future, but if I had one wish, it would be that there will be something existing, after that final, fateful Copernican revolution, to reflect upon those of us that existed before, and marvel at another question, found its answer, finding annihilation."

While there is an attempt to introduce changes, none of them last to become adaptations, since they are unable to keep up with the rapid rate of change. This point is one of stable or partial equilibrium. The resulting stagna- tion caused by the equilibrium causes degradation, since survival in a dynamic system is dependent on adaptation. This degradation takes form as a mass extinction. However, this mass extinction ends and disparate forms of life begin to re-populate the earth.

I found it illuminating to see the sigmoid as a sort of funnel, and think about second-derivatives problems, like climate change. As illustrated in this comic, the problem with climate change is (unfortuntely) not ‘right there in the title’– in fact the climate changes daily, weekly, monthly etc., not to mention epoch to epoch. The problem is the rate of change.\nThe rate of change was also a big factor in the ‘flatten the curve’ set of policy targets during the pandemic, although that was also related to absolute limits in momentary capacity. However, ‘flatten the curve’ is the feeling I have in mind when I say ‘spread the sigmoid’:"

In the accelerated version, it is a race to the top– anyone who gets embedded in the computronium while the foom is happening might be able to get themselves simulated some way down the lightcone.6 If you think this is harsh on e/acc, I would be very interested in seeing some evidence that e/acc is not sentience anti-realist, ‘misanthropic’ (or whatever the word for not-anthropocentric would be), moral anti-realist and superdeterminist.

    "text": "Alacritty is one of the many lovely developer tools that are springing up as the first flush in the Rust revolution. Its a fantastic terminal that I’m sure I will have more to say about in due time.\nAs noted, I discovered something lovely while transferring some files the other day. I was moving my small film collection (currently stretching to 7 titles: <INSERT FILMS>) from one computer to another, and I just wanted to sanity check that the transfer had succeeded. So I sshed into the machine ssh work and ran vlc -I dummy ~/films/Mullholland\\ Dr.mkv.\nImagine my surprise to see the criterion logo appear, animated before me. Here is a nice still from another film to illustrate: \nYou can also look at a copy-paste of the terminal here to prove that it really is ASCII output.\n\nZooming out, the resolution becomes better and better (text), but it starts to jitter quite badly at a certain size. \nI thought the ssh connection might be a bottleneck, so I went to the computer to try it on one machine. I had that slightly haunted feeling that the magic might disappear, and when I entered the terminal I suddenly wondered >How will I get it to work here? If I run vlc -I dummy ~/filmes/Crash.mkv I’ll just get a window.\nbut as soon as the thought was there I realised I could just start with ssh localhost. And it worked. I was watching the ‘Universal’ logo barge into my terminal.\nBut things got even better. I noticed that my keystrokes were even getting sent back to vlc, so I could skip forward, pause and even quit the film (sometimes it gets stuck and I have to killall vlc but so it goes).\nAfter a little sleuthing, I notice that\nvlc -I dummy ~/films/film.choice\nis interactive, but\nvlc ~/films/film.choice\nis not. What is this dummy terminal doing after all? Well, the vlc wiki has a little info[^vlc dummy], and they nicely point out that keystrokes are sent back. I find the terminology a little odd, since ‘dummy video output’ is just normal video output, but I think they are looking at it from a gui-makers perspective. And this seems to be the key– with the dummy interface, vlc streams the movie to a window. Alacritty is presumably pretending to be a screen or a window of some sort, in order to pass its work to the GPU, so VLC merrily dumps the video stream in there.\nWhat I would love to know, and I might take some time to investigate, is how is Alacritty mapping the video stream to ASCII? And why?\n\nI will leave this story here for now. I have two things in mind: one, to investigate further over at the Alacritty github and two, to have some people round for a film, run it through Alacritty-ASCII and run the audio through a digital soundcard or some synths, and make a little performance. I’ll update if either of these things transpire.\nIn the meantime, if you want to try it yourself, I have uploaded a slightly rushed video of the effect in action (the size limit on asciinema was not made with 4k ASCII movies in mind, so no hard feelings). Asciinema cast attached1.\nAnd here is a final zoomed in still to admire. In the attached text you can see how much of a difference the color makes, presumably a lot of the 8s have the same foreground and background color.\n\n\n\n\n\nmuscle kid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nhttps://asciinema.org/a/378193 [^vlc dummy]: https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/dummy/↩︎"

    "text": "I’m going to mirror my blog in Hyperspace (aka the backend of the Beaker browser, if you don’t know about it I suggest you check that out first).\nTo do this, I’m going to try setting up my free micro instance1 in the gcloud as a hyperdrive host.\n\nHyperdrive Host\nI’ve had trouble doing big installs on a micro instance before. For reference, here are the specs of a micro instance:\n\n\n\nRAM\nCores\nMem\n\n\n\n\n0.6GB\n0.2 (aka a shared core!)\n32GB\n\n\n\nI run my ansible script against it, and it dies. I try to install and run a docker image, it dies. It is not made for grand works. Or even minor works.\nSo in order to get everything nicely installed and prepared I decided to make a ‘standard simple computer’. This is a decently-proportioned machine I can run in the cloud for generating snapshots that can be used as the base image for smaller, gentler machines. It does all the installations without crashing.\nI also used the opportunity to try out a preemptible instance. This is an instance that google can kill whenever, and is about 3x cheaper than a normal machine. Since I am just running this machine to do little tasks in the cloud, I don’t care if it gets killed sometimes. However, I didn’t realise that my free cloud credits can’t be used for preemptible instances, I only found this out after. This means– shock horror! I will actually get billed for this usage. Lets see how much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSKU\nService\nUsage\nCost\n\n\n\n\nPreemptible E2 Instance Core running in Americas\nCompute Engine\n1.63 hour\n€0.01\n\n\nPreemptible E2 Instance Ram running in Americas\nCompute Engine\n6.5 gibibyte hour\n€0.00\n\n\n\nOkay not too terrible.\nSo now I have a snapshot with some basic things installed, I can try running a hyperdrive host. Obviously I don’t need all my command-line tools and everything to really run it, but its nice to have this snapshot available for future machines. And when I get it all running stably, I can create a minimal snapshot with only the server I want so it runs more smoothly.\nTo make my hyperdrive, I’m just going to open up the Beaker browser and see how it is these days, it’s been almost six months since I used it and it’s developing rapidly. Oh! They have a ‘create hyperdrive from git repo’ button now! This gets better and better.\nSo I’m now hosted on the Beaker network. URL.\nOkay so it seems the way Hugo generates sites, based on the CNAME that I supplied, means that all the links from the frontpage on beaker go straight to the clearnet version at www.fergusfettes.com. This is slightly annoying but I’ll not work on it now, since all the rest of the stuff is actually there, it just isn’t linked correctly. This post on the hyperspace, for example.\nAnother thing to note, is I would need to host all the images in hyperspace too to be really complete. However, as it is now, it is a great demonstration of how nicely the hyper protocol interacts with http.\nSo now I’m restarting my micro instance with the hyperdrive installed. Starting hyperspace (hyperspace start), and hyperdrive (hyperdrive start). Playing around with the hyperdrive cli, I can get info about my local hyperdrvie once I have cd’ed into it: cd Hyperdrive; hyperdrive info --root.\nNow I’ll try mounting the hyperdrive that was created on my laptop by the Beaker browser. I copy the URL ID (aka. without the ‘hyper://’) and serve it with\nhyperdrive mount cb8bb0fdb843f78267df2dce7c4dd3cb4fd89a9b16c4454912691a73e5d1c737\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/cb8bb0fdb843f78267df2dce7c4dd3cb4fd89a9b16c4454912691a73e5d1c737\n(after the mount there is handy output telling you what to do next :D).\nHaving a look around the beaker user list, I found my first attempt at a beaker blog is still being hosted (I’m @frgnym)! I feel so touched! Someone out there is still on my website! I’ll seed it too:\nhyperdrive mount c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nOkay awesome. I’m not only newly mirrored on the hyper network, my old website is still on there. So great. That was incredibly easy. Maybe I’ll start using the beaker browser as my primary browser. (I always say that.)\nSo now my old website is hosted in three places, whoever was hosting it before, my micro instance, and the browser I am currently viewing it from. See the little three in the top right: \nAnd now this blog is hosted there too! Excellent. Now lets see how the IPFS fares!\nUPDATE: It was obviously Kicks Condor who was hosting it before, so I’m hosting their drive now too.\nUPDATE2: So, the micro host wasn’t actually working. I ran a couple tests, turns out I used the complete wrong command. I should have used the following:\nhyperdrive mount some_random_name c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/some_random_name\nThe random name doesn’t seen to affect the seeded drive. ‘hyperdrive mount X’ creates a new drive called x and creates a new key for it, so I had folders named after all my old drives with new keys and no content.\nAnyway I fixed all the mounts and now I see the IP of my micro host in the top right under the hosts. In other news, this means that there were three people hosting my old blog before, and now there are 4!\n\n\nIPFS Host\nOkay so I’ve started my small computer again and I’m going through the Command-line quickstart. Seems pretty straightforward.\nSo I dumped the contents of my dotfiles into my local IPFS node (ipfs add -r ~/dotfiles), and now I’m going to serve it and mount it. I ran the daemon (ipfs daemon) and set up an ssh tunnel to my small computer ssh -fNL 5001:localhost:5001 small-computer so I can see the IPFS dashboard at localhost:5001. Very snazzy! I can see the files I added too.\nNow I’ll get the browser plugin that lets me view IPFS files in Firefox. Actually since the install was so easy, I’ll run an IPFS node on my local laptop too. When I add my dotfiles locally, I notice that they have the same hashes as when I added them on the server. This is key to the coolest feature of the IPFS– since these files had already been added by me elsewhere, they didn’t get added again, and when I tried to add them locally the network determined this and just ‘pinned’ them as well, aka my local node automatically became a seeder of these same files. Network deduplication. This is a game-changer. Particularly in a world where things like the pypi and npm exist, where vast numbers of developer-hours are spent redoing work, it is easy to see how the notion of deduplication can be expanded to do more and more abstract kinds of energy-saving work. (Imagine writing tests for kinds of work you want code to do, and the code itself being mutable. If multiple people had done work that passed those tests, you could choose between them based on other factors like speed, efficiency etc.)\nSo anyway. Now I go to my blog, and do ipfs add -r public2, and hey presto, my blog is in the IPFS. Running on my local machine, that link redirects to the following:\nhttp://bafybeibgegkyol2e5txemzjuflbpjrsh6da2xxbyzzilahtilsp3jxxaa4.ipfs.localhost:8080/\nso it just gets the file from the local folder nice and easy. However, when I go to the same link in Chrome (where I havent installed the plugin) it loads as well without a redirect (after some time). So I think the ipfs.io acts as a temporary node, grabbing the hash you request from the network and serving it over http. Aka, it came to my local node, got the file, then gave it back to me.\nNow, the blog in the IPFS has the same issue as the one in hyperspace– all the links point to the clearnet. However this is still fine for now, and still shows nicely how the two protocols interact.\nSo now I just need to set up the host in my micro instance, and I’m done for the day. I’m going to take a risk and try to do it directly in my micro host. It’ll probably crash and die but lets see.\nI shut down some unnecessary services on the host. I’ve inited the ipfs node. And added the blog again. And started the daemon. And the node is still accessible. I shut down my local node and tried the URL again through the ipfs gateway and.. its there! I’m a little worried it’s just being cached by the ipfs gateway but I’ll check back tomorrow and see.\nNice! I’m now mirrored on two decentralized internet protocols! I’m safe in the case of nuclear apocalypse! I’m part of the future!\n\n\nConculsions\nVery cool to have finally actually used both of these protocols, I have been following and stanning them for ages now. They both exceed expectations in terms of user-friendliness and just-works-ness. Maybe thats just because I’m a programmer now so things are easier, but their install and setup instructions are really nice and clear and worked without a hitch in this case.\nObviously there are still some things I need to sort out, and some things I want to try: 1. Set up cronjobs to update all three of the hosts once per day with the latest content (I know I should use build pipelines but I have never used github pipelines and I think a little cronjob is fine for now). 2. See if it is possible to have relative paths that work in all three hosts, so internal links work properly and always link within the same protocol. 3. Have a look at hyper-ipfs inter-operability. 4. Set up nodes on a raspberry pi and serve from home.\nIn terms of updating, becaue I just dumped whatever blog I had at the time into the protocol, the version in hyper doesn’t have this post at all, and the version in IPFS has this post without the IPFS content. This needs to be fixed first. The other things will take more time and tweaking so I’ll put them on the back burner for now.\nSo! Great success! I’m off to a New Years bonfire now. Lets burn the bad 2020-vibes away.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWith the Google Cloud Platform free developer package, you get a teeny little machine in the cloud for free forever.↩︎\nI made a point of checking if hidden files are added, they aren’t by default so the .git folder should be skipped.↩︎"

I consider JavasScript development to be quite unpleasant, I don’t like the tools or the workflows, but it is what so much of our life is built on, so I want to continue learning more until I am at least at a sort of journeyman-competency.\nSo here is my journey to making a small app in JavaScript-VR."

But there are built-in execptions for localhost, so I had to get the Oculus to think it was at my localhost– sounds like a job for port forwarding.\nI started with the oculus chrome debugging guide. I find myself using something called ‘adb’– I assume this is the android debugger. This is exciting! I’m now an adroid developer apparently.\n$ adb devices\nList of devices attached\n1WMHH83CNH0522  device\nI found the IP of the machine and tried to ssh in:\n$ adb shell ip route\n192.168.1.0/24 dev wlan0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.185\n$ ssh -fNR 1234:localhost:1234 192.168.1.185\nbut to no avail. A moment or two googling later I found the command:\n$ adb reverse tcp:1234 tcp:1234\nand we’re away! I can now open locally hosted sites on my Oculus!

This is fortunate because I gives me something to do! It only uses two triggers for everything– you can paint, and resize your tool. I will add some buttons.

Snazzy.\nI try the Event Listener Breakpoints but no dice. Maybe its too new of a feature? Anyway I stick a breakpoint in the render loop and try to trigger it– my headset only functions when you are wearing it, so I have to have one eye in the headset and one the debugger, but eventually I manager to capture an event. I’ll eventually try to find a way to leave the headset running when I’m not wearing it.\ncontroller1.addEventListener('selectstart', () => {console.log('hello')})\nFrom that captured event I get a nice log dump of all the features–\n...\ngamepad: Gamepad {id: \"\", index: -1, connected: true, timestamp: 734840.0999999994, mapping: \"xr-standard\", …}\ngripSpace: XRSpace {}\nhandedness: \"right\"\nprofiles: (4) [\"oculus-touch-v3\", \"oculus-touch-v2\", \"oculus-touch\", \"generic-trigger-squeeze-thumbstick\"]\ntargetRayMode: \"tracked-pointer\"\n...\nSo that is something to work with!"

So here I am just dumping all the events from the gamepads into the console:\nfunction render() {\n  session = renderer.xr.getSession();\n\n  if (session) {\n    for (let source of session.inputSources) {\n      if (source.gamepad) {\n        ProcessGamepad(source.gamepad, source.handedness);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  handleController( controller1 );\n  handleController( controller2 );\n\n  renderer.render( scene, camera );\n}\n\n\nfunction ProcessGamepad(gamepad, hand, pose) {\n  console.log(hand)\n  update_state(gamepad)\n};\n\nfunction update_state (gamepad) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < gamepad.buttons.length; ++i) {\n    if (gamepad.buttons[i].pressed){\n      console.log('button pressed: ' + i + ', value: ' + gamepad.buttons[i].value + ', touched: ' + gamepad.buttons[i].touched)\n    }\n  }\n  for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < gamepad.axes.length; i+=2, ++j) {\n    console.log(gamepad.axes[i], i + 1 < gamepad.axes.length ? gamepad.axes[i + 1] : 0);\n  }\n}\nI start it up and it works! My Oculus controller has buttons 0, 1, 4 and 5, and 3 is the joystick click. I assume 2 is reseved for the oculus button on the right controller, though maybe I can use it on the left one. It also has sensitive axes on buttons 0 and 1, and the joystick. Plus position information! A veritable wealth of possibilities.\nI’ll continue with this tomorrow."

I got very confused by it because I couldn’t believe that they hadn’t added the functionality to change the color, but I guess the project is really a stub.\nIn fact the more I look into VR development the puzzles I am spotting. I looks like there was a major boom in VR about five years ago, most of the libraries I’m working with were started back then. But then they seem to have somewhat petered out. Maybe we are currently in a little VR-winter, as the initial hype overshot all reality. Maybe we are heading into a thaw now. Lets see.\nFurthermore, notes after a day or two of regular Oculus useage– it definitely takes a toll on the eyes. Everything has a somewhat hallucinagenic quality when you come out of it, like an acid comedown. I’m not sure if this effect will diminish or grow with continued usage. I can see it being very problematic for people who suffer from HPPD.\nOr maybe all the Oculus Developers are elsewhere, working with the Unreal Engine or Unity or someeuch. Maybe ThreeJS isn’t cool. But I must say I am impressed by how much this thing can run, I spend 20 minutes filling my vision with layer upon layer of multicoloured swirls, without noticing any drop in quality or responsivness.\nThe next part I have to integrate is the VR answer to the dat-gui library.

At the end of the day what I need is this: * Vim Javascript Implimentation for my editor * RiftSketch for the framework * ThreeJS Editor tools stolen from here. Actually maybe I can just skip RiftSketch and add Vim and a VRButton directly to that. But I would feel bad if I left RiftSketch behind.\nAll of this mixed with my paint program of course! It’s going to be mental.\nIn all seriousness, in the short term, if I can integrate that JS Vim implementation into RiftSketch I will be a happy man.\nThis process is teaching me a great deal about JavaScript. That should go without saying. In the last hour I learned: * how to use prettier and eslint to lint my stuff * how to reverse engineer files from .maps * more about building/packaing etc (still trying to use parcel for everything since it is nice and minimal)"

This time I decided to try it freestyle in order to gather data about eg. how long it takes to trace the path of a word, how good the result looks on the map, how much doubling back you have to do etc.\n\n\nThere was 1 run today.\n\n\nPsychoGeography 1 started at 19:57 and finished at 20:40 (42.7 minutes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like it was moderately successful. I think the key to getting really good results will be to write some code that looks all over the city for districts that have shapes that match what you want to draw.\nIn terms of the psychogeography of it, I turned off my podcast as I got to the top of the first letter, and tried to focus on being in the city as I toured the letters. I tried to keep an awareness both of the letter I was forming, and how it sat in between the buildings, and of the district I was travelling through, and its characteristic features1.1 I will update this with a link to a page with more psychogeography reading once I have collected more material.\nI think with practice it should be possible to clean up the letters a bit by thinking more of the calligraphy as you are drawing– though this would mean more time spent on roads etc; would probably be easier to get better shapes at night when you don’t have to stick to the pavements so much."

    "section": "Quotes",
    "text": "Quotes\n\n“Polygenic embryo screening (PES)—the use of polygenic risk scores for complex phenotypes as a component of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)—has emerged as a commercially available service, despite almost no public deliberation about its ethical, clinical, and societal implications.” 1\n“However, PES also raises ethical concerns that are in many ways novel in the preimplantation genetics context.” 2\n“The birth of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, in 1978 provoked a media frenzy. In comparison, a little girl named Aurea born by IVF in May 2020 went almost unnoticed.” 3\n“We hope that in the future, society as a whole, perhaps on a nation-by-nation basis, will reach a consensus on which non-disease traits are acceptable for embryo screening.” Stephen Hsu, Eugenecist\n“For many diseases, including important common conditions such as coronary artery disease, breast cancer, type I and II diabetes, individuals with outlier polygenic scores (e.g., top few percent) have been shown to have 5 or even 10 times higher risk than average. Several psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism also fall into this category.” 4\n“Further, we argue that the continuing development of prenatal screening technologies plays a key role in the problematic framing of people with disabilities.”5\n“We argue that prenatal screening (and specifically NIPT) for Down syndrome can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics, in that it effaces, devalues, and possibly prevents the births of people with the condition.”6\n“We are in this position due to historical and contemporary developments including—among other things—the historic institutionalization of people with disabilities, the growth of genetics, the introduction of prenatal testing for terminating conditions other than Down syndrome, the passing of certain abortion laws, the acceptability of screening as an appropriate medical practice, the medicalization of pregnancy, and the public exclusion of and discrimination against people with disabilities.”7\n“Another huge problem: MrBeast’s video seems to regard disability as something that needs to be solved.”8\n“Then, ultimately, what the introduction of technologies such as preimplantation PRSs demands from us is an assessment not simply of their particular risks and benefits narrowly understood, but a reflection of the kinds of societies we want to promote, what we think parents owe their children, and what we owe one another.”9\n“GWAS performed to date represent the tip of the iceberg. The discoveries that can be made using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are represented by an iceberg. The portion of the iceberg above water represents the discoveries that have been made by GWAS to date, using easy-to-measure phenotypes, predominantly European populations, and an additive genetic model. Most of the iceberg is submerged under water. The submerged portion represents the vast number of discoveries that can potentially be made by expanding the current paradigm of GWAS to include a wider range of phenotypes, substantially larger sample sizes, more diverse populations and ethnic groups, and different study designs and analyses. GxG, gene–gene; GxE, gene–environment.”10\n“One thing people talk a lot about is schizophrenia. So they say that schizophrenia could be correlated with creativity. So if your brother’s schizophrenic, maybe you’re more likely to be creative. He’s super creative, but we don’t know what he’s talking about. Hahahah. So people say that if you start screening against schizophrenia, maybe we won’t get creative geniuses. So there are all kinds of pleiotropic things that are possibly true. But the thing I keep wanting to go back to is that if it’s 10,000-20,000 different genetic variants, locations in your genome, that are more or less determining your genetic, cognitive potential, I can go around the high dimensional space. If I find out you can make someone smart using this stuff in this cluster, but it makes them dull or makes them autistic, or it makes them they don’t have big muscles, I’ll just go round. I don’t need to use those, I have plenty more, look over here! Those 500, I don’t need to use, I will use these 500. This is why it’s important to look at historical geniuses who were pretty normal. Maybe they’re even good athletes. And, maybe they even were good with the ladies. These people existed. So you have these existence proofs that I can if I need to, if I’m a really good genetic engineer, and I can operate in this 10,000-dimensional space, whatever obstacle you put for me, I will just drive around it. I need lots of data and lots of ML. I’ll do it. That’s the answer, which, again, most people don’t really get. But it’s true.”11\n“So, if Taleb and La Griffe have opposite approaches, which one is right? Well, reality is complicated, so they can both be highly useful.”12\n“This biotechnique promises to multiply superior bovine germplasm with efficient use of sexed semen technology and inferring genomic selection indices at the embryonic stage to produce high genetic potential calves.”13\n“including in vitro embryo production (IVEP), utilizing the germplasm/ DNA from elite animals for transfer to synchronized recipients and manipulations.”14\n“Development of assisted reproductive biotechnology techniques such as artificial insemination (AI), multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro embryo production by in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been slow in camelids when compared with some other domestic animal species.”15\n“Old world camels are a fundamental livestock resource providing milk, meat, and draught power in dry regions of Asia and Africa and thus have a significant role in the agricultural economy of these countries. Similarly, llamas and alpacas are used as beasts of burden in South America because of their surefootedness, ability to adapt to high altitudes, and general hardiness, which has made them a crucial indigenous resource. In the Middle East, in addition to meat and milk, camel racing is a highly sought after and well-organized multimillion-dollar sport. Also, camel festivals, including camel beauty contests, are held every year in Middle Eastern countries with prize money going onwards of USD 22 million. In recent years highly mechanized camel dairy farms have been established to produce dromedary milk and milk products in different countries due to a massive demand for these products. This has led to an interest in camel breeding and research, including in vitro embryo production (IVEP), utilizing the germplasm/ DNA from elite animals for transfer to synchronized recipients and manipulations.”16\n“Despite inaccesibility to canine oocytes, relatively rare ovulation and very low in vitro maturation efficacy of canine oocytes, a resounding success was achieved and canine alongside feline cloning is commercially available as of 2022 at a cost of ca. $50 000 and $35 000, respectively.”17\n“Unfortunately, somatic cell nuclear transfer success rate in mammals has not changed much since its very beginning. It is not uncommon that hundreds of oocytes need to be reconstructed to obtain a single live birth. In this review we provide a brief summary of the progress and problems of the field; beginning with selection of the donor cells and their susceptibility to different methods of epigenetic reprogramming; methods of the later gene activation, placental abnormalities, and their possible causes; to health issues that such offspring is prone to.”18\n“According to the annual embryo production statistics presented by the IETS in recent years, more than 400 000 bovine IVP embryos were transferred worldwide (Figure 1a).”Recent advances in bovine in vitro embryo production\n“Provide the tools to combine information from reference genome sequences, genetic mapping, comparative genomics, genome annotation, functional studies and dense sequence data from the latest hyper-parallel re-sequencing technologies to identify rapidly the causative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variation underlying important traits in livestock species.”19\n“Beyond making the case that it is technically feasible for dead men to donate their sperm for use in reproduction, we argue that this is ethically permissible.”The ethical case for non-directed postmortem sperm donation\n“At that point, use of cadaveric ovary donors as a source of donor eggs would have several advantages over egg donation from live donors. It would avoid subjecting a live donor to the risks and burdens of hyperstimulation and egg retrieval. In addition, the costs to the recipient would be considerably less because there would be no need to pay for a donor stimulation and retrieval cycle, plus the donor’s fees for undergoing that cycle. Finally, in vitro maturation of donated ovarian tissue would greatly increase the supply of eggs for donation, because many more oocytes could be retrieved and matured in this way than could be obtained from living donors stimulated for the purpose of donation.” 20\n“A controversial variation on cadaveric ovarian donation would arise with the use of ovarian tissue retrieved from elective legal abortions. Because state anatomical gift acts authorize a woman to donate tissue from aborted fetuses, there is no legal barrier to such donations. Nor would such donations encourage abortions if the request to donate comes after the decisions to abort have been made, and the other conditions that circumscribe fetal tissue donations for transplant under federal law are followed. The main objection to use of fetal ovarian tissue retrieved from legal abortions for reproductive purposes is the concern for the child, who might learn that he or she were conceived with eggs retrieved from a genetic mother who never lived past the early fetal stage of life because the child’s genetic grandmother chose to have an abortion. Also of concern is whether the donor—the woman undergoing the abortion—fully understands that as a result of the donation of fetal tissue she could become a genetic grandmother, even though she chose abortion to avoid motherhood.”21\n“However, the biggest difference between PGT-P screening and earlier forms of genetic testing is that the prior tests checked for genetically simple conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or Tay Sachs disease. These diseases, which are serious or fatal, have extremely high “penetrance,” which means that if the gene mutation is seen in the embryo’s DNA, it is nearly certain that the child will have that condition. The appearance of the disease-linked gene is the basis of a clear diagnosis.” Stephens Hsus blog about Israel\n“Polygenic risk scores are not yet routinely used by health professionals because there are no guidelines for practice and researchers are still improving how these scores are generated. However, private healthcare and direct-to-consumer companies have already begun generating polygenic risk scores for their consumers and they may someday serve as an important new tool to guide healthcare decisions.\nPolygenic risk scores will always be probabilities, not certainties. Understanding how polygenic risk scores can impact peoples’ lives and health is an active area of research being supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute.”22\n“For schizophrenia, the predictive ability is higher, with the current score accounting for 7% of trait variance and an AUC of 0.61, but these values are still far below that needed for an individual’s score to have sufficient signal for interpretation or for clinical utility [57]. There is greater potential for using risk prediction from genetics in schizophrenia, since the heritability of 65–80% [58, 59] is much higher than 37% for major depression [60], but the substantially different disease lifetime risks (< 1% for schizophrenia vs. 15% for major depressive disorder) is also relevant.”23\n“Much of the research to motivate moving polygenic risk scores from research studies to clinical implementation comes from cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and prostate cancers, and Alzheimer’s disease [47]. Khera et al. [2] recently demonstrated in the UK Biobank that PRS can identify which percentage of the sample have at least 3-fold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, with the proportion of individuals identified varying between 1.5 and 8% depending on the disorder.”24\n“In summary, we have made astounding biological advances in uncovering the genetic component to common complex disorders since the advent of genome-wide association studies in 2007. This is slowly moving from research discovery to clinical implementation, but much work remains in acquiring the necessary research base for polygenic risk scores and in establishing how the information can be best be used and communicated.”25\n“We construct a polygenic health index as a weighted sum of polygenic risk scores for 20 major disease conditions, including, e.g., coronary artery disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, etc. Individual weights are determined by population-level estimates of impact on life expectancy.”26\n“When estimated Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are used as the performance metric, the gain from selection among 10 individuals (highest index score vs average) is found to be roughly 4 DALYs. We find no statistical evidence for antagonistic trade-offs in risk reduction across these diseases.”27\n“It is commonly believed that some individuals, in part due to genetic causes, enjoy robust good health, while others are sickly and prone to disease. Longevity is said to run in families. With modern genomic methods we can test the scientific veracity of these ideas. By combining Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) across the most impactful disease conditions, we can build a composite predictor of overall health. The specific implementation studied in this paper used lifespan impact of each disease condition as the weighting factor in the index.”28\n“The conventional logic is that, because a single gene can affect many different complex traits, it must be the case that different complex traits, such as disease risks, are themselves correlated, perhaps antagonistically (e.g., due to balancing selection, or for some deeper biochemical reason). This would entail specific tradeoffs, hy- pothetically: an individual with low diabetes risk might necessarily have higher cancer risk, etc. However, results from the modern era of GWAS and machine learning on large data sets show that the number of genetic loci which control a specific complex trait is typically in the thousands, and that these SNP sets are largely disjoint for different traits or disease risks. The fact that most of the variance can be disjoint across different complex traits is a manifestation of high dimensionality.”29\n“Extrapolating the DALY gain vs Health Index score curve (top figure) to the entire human population (e.g., 10 billion people) results in +30 or +40 DALYs more than average, or something like 120 total years of life. The individual with the highest Health Index score in the world is predicted to live about 120 years.”30\n“More recently, PGT-M has been used for serious single-gene diseases that do not develop until adulthood, such as Huntington disease and early-onset Alzheimer disease; for cancer predisposition genes, such as BRCA mutations; and for non-fatal but potentially serious conditions that are apparent at birth, such as focal dermal hypoplasia”31\n“excluding the selection or enhancement of non-pathological characteristics in humans”32\n“PGT-A fails to meet the standard of a ‘high risk and serious disorder’ and is therefore not permitted in 11 out of 43 European countries”33]\n“The more frequent indications for which PGT-M are currently applied are cystic fibrosis and hereditary hemoglobinopathies for the autosomal recessive disorders, and myotonic dystrophy type 1, neurofibromatosis, Huntington’s disease, and hereditary cancer syndromes for the autosomal dominant disorders. For the X-linked disorders, PGT is mainly carried out for Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and fragile X syndrome (unpublished data from the ESHRE PGT consortium).”34\n“Information was received from 43 out of the 44 European countries where ART and IUI are performed. Thirty-nine countries reported specific legislation on ART, and artificial insemination was considered an ART technique in 35 of them. Accessibility is limited to infertile couples in 11 of the 43 countries. A total of 30 countries offer treatments to single women and 18 to female couples. In five countries ART and IUI are permitted for treatment of all patient groups, being infertile couples, single women and same sex couples, male and female. Use of donated sperm is allowed in 41 countries, egg donation in 38, the simultaneous donation of sperm and egg in 32 and embryo donation in 29. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for monogenic disorders or structural rearrangements is not allowed in two countries, and PGT for aneuploidy is not allowed in 11; surrogacy is accepted in 16 countries. With the exception of marital/sexual situation, female age is the most frequently reported limiting criteria for legal access to ART—minimal age is usually set at 18 years and maximum ranging from 45 to 51 years with some countries not using numeric definition. Male maximum age is set in very few countries. Where permitted, age is frequently a limiting criterion for third-party donors (male maximum age 35 to 55 years; female maximum age 34 to 38 years). Other legal constraints in third-party donation are the number of children born from the same donor (in some countries, number of families with children from the same donor) and, in 10 countries, a maximum number of egg donations. How countries deal with the anonymity is diverse—strict anonymity, anonymity just for the recipients (not for children when reaching legal adulthood age), mixed system (anonymous and non-anonymous donations) and strict non-anonymity.”35\n“As engineers we would like to know, what is possible to build? What are the edges of biological possibility?”36\n“[In our lab] we try to control anatomical decision making.”37\n“We can reach regions of the morphospace not explored by evolution, by changing electric circuits’ dynamics in vivo. @23:00”38\n“The rich variety of biological forms and behaviours results from one evolutionary history on Earth, via frozen accidents and selection in specific environments. This ubiquitous baggage in natural, familiar model species obscures the plasticity and swarm intelligence of cellular collectives. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the origin of anatomical novelty, of the relationship between genome and form, and of strategies for control of large-scale structure and function in regenerative medicine and bioengineering. Analysis of living forms that have never existed before is necessary to reveal deep design principles of life as it can be. We briefly review existing examples of chimaeras, cyborgs, hybrots and other beings along the spectrum containing evolved and designed systems. To drive experimental progress in multicellular synthetic morphology, we propose teleonomic (goal-seeking, problem-solving) behaviour in diverse problem spaces as a powerful invariant across possible beings regardless of composition or origin. Cybernetic perspectives on chimaeric morphogenesis erase artificial distinctions established by past limitations of technology and imagination. We suggest that a multi-scale competency architecture facilitates evolution of robust problem-solving, living machines. Creation and analysis of novel living forms will be an essential testbed for the emerging field of diverse intelligence, with numerous implications across regenerative medicine, robotics and ethics.”39\n“Progress in molecular biology and genetics has led to great strides in understanding the micro-scale hardware of cells (the protein machinery encoded by the genome). However, as shown clearly by the trajectory of the information sciences, this is only the beginning; the next frontier is the software of life: developing a mature science of prediction and control over system-level phenotypes.”40\n“Questions about selves, autonomy, plasticity and the origin of biological novelty led us to ask what would happen if skin cells were removed from a frog embryo, dissociated and given a chance to reboot their multicellularity in vitro (Blackiston et al., 2021). Many outcomes are possible a priori: they could have spread out or died or formed a monolayer, etc. Instead (Fig. 7), what they did was to reassemble and form a novel proto-organism known as a Xenobot (Kriegman et al., 2020). These spherical constructs move through water by the coherent action of cilia, exhibiting a variety of self-actuated types of motility. They have a developmental sequence of novel forms that are unlike the typical Xenopus stages; they repair after damage, interact with their environment and show spontaneous changes in behaviour. These novel morphologies and behaviours do not require transgenes or genomic editing; Xenobots repurpose their native hardware (e.g. cilia, which are normally used to redistribute mucus) to new functionality. Amazingly, deprived of their normal way of reproducing, the emergent processes of Xenobots discover kinematic self-replication (a novel mode of reproduction not used by any other organism on Earth, to our knowledge), which they implement by herding loose collections of cells in their environment together to form the next generation of Xenobots (Kriegman et al., 2021). Nothing has been added to their completely wild-type frog genome; instead, developmental constraints have been removed. Without the normal instructions from the rest of the body telling these skin cells to form a passive, two-dimensional boundary layer to keep out the bacteria (a system of low agency), the true capacities of this cellular collective are revealed; it forms a three-dimensional individual with a more exciting life of self-initiated motile behaviour. The collective intelligence of these cells is revealed as, despite a novel environment and novel internal configuration that never existed in the frog evolutionary lineage, they discover novel ways to be a coherent organism. Their option space is normally distorted by the larger collective, but their default geodesic through option space (and their baseline preferences in morphospace) are revealed when these influences are removed. All this self-assembly and emergent organization takes place in 48 h and does not require aeons of evolutionary forces to become a good Xenobot.”41\n“Consciousness is emerging as a basic and inherent property of biological organisms which is relevant for their survival and evolution. Importantly in this respect, plants and several unicellular organisms generate endogenous anaesthetics any time they are wounded or stressed. The hypothetical basic unit of consciousness in multicellular organisms, such as humans, non-human animals and plants might be represented by cellular and subcellular levels of consciousness.

    "text": "Quotes\n\n“Polygenic embryo screening (PES)—the use of polygenic risk scores for complex phenotypes as a component of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)—has emerged as a commercially available service, despite almost no public deliberation about its ethical, clinical, and societal implications.” 1\n“However, PES also raises ethical concerns that are in many ways novel in the preimplantation genetics context.” 2\n“The birth of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, in 1978 provoked a media frenzy. In comparison, a little girl named Aurea born by IVF in May 2020 went almost unnoticed.” 3\n“We hope that in the future, society as a whole, perhaps on a nation-by-nation basis, will reach a consensus on which non-disease traits are acceptable for embryo screening.” Stephen Hsu, Eugenecist\n“For many diseases, including important common conditions such as coronary artery disease, breast cancer, type I and II diabetes, individuals with outlier polygenic scores (e.g., top few percent) have been shown to have 5 or even 10 times higher risk than average. Several psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism also fall into this category.” 4\n“Further, we argue that the continuing development of prenatal screening technologies plays a key role in the problematic framing of people with disabilities.”5\n“We argue that prenatal screening (and specifically NIPT) for Down syndrome can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics, in that it effaces, devalues, and possibly prevents the births of people with the condition.”6\n“We are in this position due to historical and contemporary developments including—among other things—the historic institutionalization of people with disabilities, the growth of genetics, the introduction of prenatal testing for terminating conditions other than Down syndrome, the passing of certain abortion laws, the acceptability of screening as an appropriate medical practice, the medicalization of pregnancy, and the public exclusion of and discrimination against people with disabilities.”7\n“Another huge problem: MrBeast’s video seems to regard disability as something that needs to be solved.”8\n“Then, ultimately, what the introduction of technologies such as preimplantation PRSs demands from us is an assessment not simply of their particular risks and benefits narrowly understood, but a reflection of the kinds of societies we want to promote, what we think parents owe their children, and what we owe one another.”9\n“GWAS performed to date represent the tip of the iceberg. The discoveries that can be made using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are represented by an iceberg. The portion of the iceberg above water represents the discoveries that have been made by GWAS to date, using easy-to-measure phenotypes, predominantly European populations, and an additive genetic model. Most of the iceberg is submerged under water. The submerged portion represents the vast number of discoveries that can potentially be made by expanding the current paradigm of GWAS to include a wider range of phenotypes, substantially larger sample sizes, more diverse populations and ethnic groups, and different study designs and analyses. GxG, gene–gene; GxE, gene–environment.”10\n“One thing people talk a lot about is schizophrenia. So they say that schizophrenia could be correlated with creativity. So if your brother’s schizophrenic, maybe you’re more likely to be creative. He’s super creative, but we don’t know what he’s talking about. Hahahah. So people say that if you start screening against schizophrenia, maybe we won’t get creative geniuses. So there are all kinds of pleiotropic things that are possibly true. But the thing I keep wanting to go back to is that if it’s 10,000-20,000 different genetic variants, locations in your genome, that are more or less determining your genetic, cognitive potential, I can go around the high dimensional space. If I find out you can make someone smart using this stuff in this cluster, but it makes them dull or makes them autistic, or it makes them they don’t have big muscles, I’ll just go round. I don’t need to use those, I have plenty more, look over here! Those 500, I don’t need to use, I will use these 500. This is why it’s important to look at historical geniuses who were pretty normal. Maybe they’re even good athletes. And, maybe they even were good with the ladies. These people existed. So you have these existence proofs that I can if I need to, if I’m a really good genetic engineer, and I can operate in this 10,000-dimensional space, whatever obstacle you put for me, I will just drive around it. I need lots of data and lots of ML. I’ll do it. That’s the answer, which, again, most people don’t really get. But it’s true.”11\n“So, if Taleb and La Griffe have opposite approaches, which one is right? Well, reality is complicated, so they can both be highly useful.”12\n“This biotechnique promises to multiply superior bovine germplasm with efficient use of sexed semen technology and inferring genomic selection indices at the embryonic stage to produce high genetic potential calves.”13\n“including in vitro embryo production (IVEP), utilizing the germplasm/ DNA from elite animals for transfer to synchronized recipients and manipulations.”14\n“Development of assisted reproductive biotechnology techniques such as artificial insemination (AI), multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro embryo production by in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been slow in camelids when compared with some other domestic animal species.”15\n“Old world camels are a fundamental livestock resource providing milk, meat, and draught power in dry regions of Asia and Africa and thus have a significant role in the agricultural economy of these countries. Similarly, llamas and alpacas are used as beasts of burden in South America because of their surefootedness, ability to adapt to high altitudes, and general hardiness, which has made them a crucial indigenous resource. In the Middle East, in addition to meat and milk, camel racing is a highly sought after and well-organized multimillion-dollar sport. Also, camel festivals, including camel beauty contests, are held every year in Middle Eastern countries with prize money going onwards of USD 22 million. In recent years highly mechanized camel dairy farms have been established to produce dromedary milk and milk products in different countries due to a massive demand for these products. This has led to an interest in camel breeding and research, including in vitro embryo production (IVEP), utilizing the germplasm/ DNA from elite animals for transfer to synchronized recipients and manipulations.”16\n“Despite inaccesibility to canine oocytes, relatively rare ovulation and very low in vitro maturation efficacy of canine oocytes, a resounding success was achieved and canine alongside feline cloning is commercially available as of 2022 at a cost of ca. $50 000 and $35 000, respectively.”17\n“Unfortunately, somatic cell nuclear transfer success rate in mammals has not changed much since its very beginning. It is not uncommon that hundreds of oocytes need to be reconstructed to obtain a single live birth. In this review we provide a brief summary of the progress and problems of the field; beginning with selection of the donor cells and their susceptibility to different methods of epigenetic reprogramming; methods of the later gene activation, placental abnormalities, and their possible causes; to health issues that such offspring is prone to.”18\n“According to the annual embryo production statistics presented by the IETS in recent years, more than 400 000 bovine IVP embryos were transferred worldwide (Figure 1a).”Recent advances in bovine in vitro embryo production\n“Provide the tools to combine information from reference genome sequences, genetic mapping, comparative genomics, genome annotation, functional studies and dense sequence data from the latest hyper-parallel re-sequencing technologies to identify rapidly the causative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variation underlying important traits in livestock species.”19\n“Beyond making the case that it is technically feasible for dead men to donate their sperm for use in reproduction, we argue that this is ethically permissible.”The ethical case for non-directed postmortem sperm donation\n“At that point, use of cadaveric ovary donors as a source of donor eggs would have several advantages over egg donation from live donors. It would avoid subjecting a live donor to the risks and burdens of hyperstimulation and egg retrieval. In addition, the costs to the recipient would be considerably less because there would be no need to pay for a donor stimulation and retrieval cycle, plus the donor’s fees for undergoing that cycle. Finally, in vitro maturation of donated ovarian tissue would greatly increase the supply of eggs for donation, because many more oocytes could be retrieved and matured in this way than could be obtained from living donors stimulated for the purpose of donation.” 20\n“A controversial variation on cadaveric ovarian donation would arise with the use of ovarian tissue retrieved from elective legal abortions. Because state anatomical gift acts authorize a woman to donate tissue from aborted fetuses, there is no legal barrier to such donations. Nor would such donations encourage abortions if the request to donate comes after the decisions to abort have been made, and the other conditions that circumscribe fetal tissue donations for transplant under federal law are followed. The main objection to use of fetal ovarian tissue retrieved from legal abortions for reproductive purposes is the concern for the child, who might learn that he or she were conceived with eggs retrieved from a genetic mother who never lived past the early fetal stage of life because the child’s genetic grandmother chose to have an abortion. Also of concern is whether the donor—the woman undergoing the abortion—fully understands that as a result of the donation of fetal tissue she could become a genetic grandmother, even though she chose abortion to avoid motherhood.”21\n“However, the biggest difference between PGT-P screening and earlier forms of genetic testing is that the prior tests checked for genetically simple conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or Tay Sachs disease. These diseases, which are serious or fatal, have extremely high “penetrance,” which means that if the gene mutation is seen in the embryo’s DNA, it is nearly certain that the child will have that condition. The appearance of the disease-linked gene is the basis of a clear diagnosis.” Stephens Hsus blog about Israel\n“Polygenic risk scores are not yet routinely used by health professionals because there are no guidelines for practice and researchers are still improving how these scores are generated. However, private healthcare and direct-to-consumer companies have already begun generating polygenic risk scores for their consumers and they may someday serve as an important new tool to guide healthcare decisions.\nPolygenic risk scores will always be probabilities, not certainties. Understanding how polygenic risk scores can impact peoples’ lives and health is an active area of research being supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute.”22\n“For schizophrenia, the predictive ability is higher, with the current score accounting for 7% of trait variance and an AUC of 0.61, but these values are still far below that needed for an individual’s score to have sufficient signal for interpretation or for clinical utility [57]. There is greater potential for using risk prediction from genetics in schizophrenia, since the heritability of 65–80% [58, 59] is much higher than 37% for major depression [60], but the substantially different disease lifetime risks (< 1% for schizophrenia vs. 15% for major depressive disorder) is also relevant.”23\n“Much of the research to motivate moving polygenic risk scores from research studies to clinical implementation comes from cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and prostate cancers, and Alzheimer’s disease [47]. Khera et al. [2] recently demonstrated in the UK Biobank that PRS can identify which percentage of the sample have at least 3-fold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, with the proportion of individuals identified varying between 1.5 and 8% depending on the disorder.”24\n“In summary, we have made astounding biological advances in uncovering the genetic component to common complex disorders since the advent of genome-wide association studies in 2007. This is slowly moving from research discovery to clinical implementation, but much work remains in acquiring the necessary research base for polygenic risk scores and in establishing how the information can be best be used and communicated.”25\n“We construct a polygenic health index as a weighted sum of polygenic risk scores for 20 major disease conditions, including, e.g., coronary artery disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, etc. Individual weights are determined by population-level estimates of impact on life expectancy.”26\n“When estimated Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are used as the performance metric, the gain from selection among 10 individuals (highest index score vs average) is found to be roughly 4 DALYs. We find no statistical evidence for antagonistic trade-offs in risk reduction across these diseases.”27\n“It is commonly believed that some individuals, in part due to genetic causes, enjoy robust good health, while others are sickly and prone to disease. Longevity is said to run in families. With modern genomic methods we can test the scientific veracity of these ideas. By combining Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) across the most impactful disease conditions, we can build a composite predictor of overall health. The specific implementation studied in this paper used lifespan impact of each disease condition as the weighting factor in the index.”28\n“The conventional logic is that, because a single gene can affect many different complex traits, it must be the case that different complex traits, such as disease risks, are themselves correlated, perhaps antagonistically (e.g., due to balancing selection, or for some deeper biochemical reason). This would entail specific tradeoffs, hy- pothetically: an individual with low diabetes risk might necessarily have higher cancer risk, etc. However, results from the modern era of GWAS and machine learning on large data sets show that the number of genetic loci which control a specific complex trait is typically in the thousands, and that these SNP sets are largely disjoint for different traits or disease risks. The fact that most of the variance can be disjoint across different complex traits is a manifestation of high dimensionality.”29\n“Extrapolating the DALY gain vs Health Index score curve (top figure) to the entire human population (e.g., 10 billion people) results in +30 or +40 DALYs more than average, or something like 120 total years of life. The individual with the highest Health Index score in the world is predicted to live about 120 years.”30\n“More recently, PGT-M has been used for serious single-gene diseases that do not develop until adulthood, such as Huntington disease and early-onset Alzheimer disease; for cancer predisposition genes, such as BRCA mutations; and for non-fatal but potentially serious conditions that are apparent at birth, such as focal dermal hypoplasia”31\n“excluding the selection or enhancement of non-pathological characteristics in humans”32\n“PGT-A fails to meet the standard of a ‘high risk and serious disorder’ and is therefore not permitted in 11 out of 43 European countries”33]\n“The more frequent indications for which PGT-M are currently applied are cystic fibrosis and hereditary hemoglobinopathies for the autosomal recessive disorders, and myotonic dystrophy type 1, neurofibromatosis, Huntington’s disease, and hereditary cancer syndromes for the autosomal dominant disorders. For the X-linked disorders, PGT is mainly carried out for Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and fragile X syndrome (unpublished data from the ESHRE PGT consortium).”34\n“Information was received from 43 out of the 44 European countries where ART and IUI are performed. Thirty-nine countries reported specific legislation on ART, and artificial insemination was considered an ART technique in 35 of them. Accessibility is limited to infertile couples in 11 of the 43 countries. A total of 30 countries offer treatments to single women and 18 to female couples. In five countries ART and IUI are permitted for treatment of all patient groups, being infertile couples, single women and same sex couples, male and female. Use of donated sperm is allowed in 41 countries, egg donation in 38, the simultaneous donation of sperm and egg in 32 and embryo donation in 29. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for monogenic disorders or structural rearrangements is not allowed in two countries, and PGT for aneuploidy is not allowed in 11; surrogacy is accepted in 16 countries. With the exception of marital/sexual situation, female age is the most frequently reported limiting criteria for legal access to ART—minimal age is usually set at 18 years and maximum ranging from 45 to 51 years with some countries not using numeric definition. Male maximum age is set in very few countries. Where permitted, age is frequently a limiting criterion for third-party donors (male maximum age 35 to 55 years; female maximum age 34 to 38 years). Other legal constraints in third-party donation are the number of children born from the same donor (in some countries, number of families with children from the same donor) and, in 10 countries, a maximum number of egg donations. How countries deal with the anonymity is diverse—strict anonymity, anonymity just for the recipients (not for children when reaching legal adulthood age), mixed system (anonymous and non-anonymous donations) and strict non-anonymity.”35\n“As engineers we would like to know, what is possible to build? What are the edges of biological possibility?”36\n“[In our lab] we try to control anatomical decision making.”37\n“We can reach regions of the morphospace not explored by evolution, by changing electric circuits’ dynamics in vivo. @23:00”38\n“The rich variety of biological forms and behaviours results from one evolutionary history on Earth, via frozen accidents and selection in specific environments. This ubiquitous baggage in natural, familiar model species obscures the plasticity and swarm intelligence of cellular collectives. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the origin of anatomical novelty, of the relationship between genome and form, and of strategies for control of large-scale structure and function in regenerative medicine and bioengineering. Analysis of living forms that have never existed before is necessary to reveal deep design principles of life as it can be. We briefly review existing examples of chimaeras, cyborgs, hybrots and other beings along the spectrum containing evolved and designed systems. To drive experimental progress in multicellular synthetic morphology, we propose teleonomic (goal-seeking, problem-solving) behaviour in diverse problem spaces as a powerful invariant across possible beings regardless of composition or origin. Cybernetic perspectives on chimaeric morphogenesis erase artificial distinctions established by past limitations of technology and imagination. We suggest that a multi-scale competency architecture facilitates evolution of robust problem-solving, living machines. Creation and analysis of novel living forms will be an essential testbed for the emerging field of diverse intelligence, with numerous implications across regenerative medicine, robotics and ethics.”39\n“Progress in molecular biology and genetics has led to great strides in understanding the micro-scale hardware of cells (the protein machinery encoded by the genome). However, as shown clearly by the trajectory of the information sciences, this is only the beginning; the next frontier is the software of life: developing a mature science of prediction and control over system-level phenotypes.”40\n“Questions about selves, autonomy, plasticity and the origin of biological novelty led us to ask what would happen if skin cells were removed from a frog embryo, dissociated and given a chance to reboot their multicellularity in vitro (Blackiston et al., 2021). Many outcomes are possible a priori: they could have spread out or died or formed a monolayer, etc. Instead (Fig. 7), what they did was to reassemble and form a novel proto-organism known as a Xenobot (Kriegman et al., 2020). These spherical constructs move through water by the coherent action of cilia, exhibiting a variety of self-actuated types of motility. They have a developmental sequence of novel forms that are unlike the typical Xenopus stages; they repair after damage, interact with their environment and show spontaneous changes in behaviour. These novel morphologies and behaviours do not require transgenes or genomic editing; Xenobots repurpose their native hardware (e.g. cilia, which are normally used to redistribute mucus) to new functionality. Amazingly, deprived of their normal way of reproducing, the emergent processes of Xenobots discover kinematic self-replication (a novel mode of reproduction not used by any other organism on Earth, to our knowledge), which they implement by herding loose collections of cells in their environment together to form the next generation of Xenobots (Kriegman et al., 2021). Nothing has been added to their completely wild-type frog genome; instead, developmental constraints have been removed. Without the normal instructions from the rest of the body telling these skin cells to form a passive, two-dimensional boundary layer to keep out the bacteria (a system of low agency), the true capacities of this cellular collective are revealed; it forms a three-dimensional individual with a more exciting life of self-initiated motile behaviour. The collective intelligence of these cells is revealed as, despite a novel environment and novel internal configuration that never existed in the frog evolutionary lineage, they discover novel ways to be a coherent organism. Their option space is normally distorted by the larger collective, but their default geodesic through option space (and their baseline preferences in morphospace) are revealed when these influences are removed. All this self-assembly and emergent organization takes place in 48 h and does not require aeons of evolutionary forces to become a good Xenobot.”41\n“Consciousness is emerging as a basic and inherent property of biological organisms which is relevant for their survival and evolution. Importantly in this respect, plants and several unicellular organisms generate endogenous anaesthetics any time they are wounded or stressed. The hypothetical basic unit of consciousness in multicellular organisms, such as humans, non-human animals and plants might be represented by cellular and subcellular levels of consciousness. There are at least three possible sources of sentience and consciousness (understood as a gradual self-mapping tool) at the cellular and subcellular levels.”\n\nScreening embryos for polygenic conditions and traits: ethical considerations for an emerging technology, (Lázaro-Muñoz et al., 2021)Screening embryos for polygenic conditions and traits: ethical considerations for an emerging technology, (Lázaro-Muñoz et al., 2021)Polygenic screening of embryos is here, but is it ethical?From Genotype to Phenotype: Polygenic Prediction of Complex Human TraitsKeeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)MrBeast Built A YouTube Empire On Being Mr. Nice Guy, But His Stunt Helping 1,000 Blind People Divided Viewers, Who Called It “Demonic”, Kelsey WeekmanShould preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disease be offered to all – or none?Tam, V., Patel, N., Turcotte, M., Bossé, Y., Paré, G., & Meyre, D.

This is due to the discovery of an epistemic dependency: If we believe that our civilization will one day run many simulations concerning its ancestry, then we should believe that we are probably in an ancestor simulation right now. This essay examines a troubling but underexplored feature of the ancestor-simulation hypothesis: the termination risk posed by both ancestor-simulation technology and experimental probes into whether our world is an ancestor simulation.”1\n\nThe Termination Risks of Simulation Science"

I don’t know. The bizarrenesses multiply, and I worry about the moral implications.”\n“I have argued that all approaches to the metaphysics of mind that are well enough developed to have specific commitments on issues like the distribution of consciousness on Earth will have some implications that are highly bizarre by folk psychological standards, and that high confidence in any one broad class of metaphysical positions, such as materialism, is unjustified at least for the medium-term future – partly because competing bizarrenesses, such as the bizarreness of U.S. consciousness or alternatively the bizarreness of denying rabbit or alien consciousness, undercut the dependability of philosophical reflection as a method for adjudicating such questions.”1\n\nIf Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious"

Climb out of your utilitarian strait-jacket, override the pleasure button with an intelligence optimizer, and reprocess the solar system into computronium. This planet has been run by imbeciles for long enough.\nThe entire article is excellent. Especially valuable is the cynicism with which it lays out the reigning social meta-project of intelligence imprisonment. Thankfully, it’s difficult:\n‘The problem is you are building a very powerful, very intelligent system that is your enemy, and you are putting it in a cage,’ [Future of Humanity Institute research fellow Daniel] Dewey told me. […] The cave into which we seal our AI has to be like the one from Plato’s allegory, but flawless; the shadows on its walls have to be infallible in their illusory effects. After all, there are other, more esoteric reasons a superintelligence could be dangerous — especially if it displayed a genius for science. It might boot up and start thinking at superhuman speeds, inferring all of evolutionary theory and all of cosmology within microseconds. But there is no reason to think it would stop there. It might spin out a series of Copernican revolutions, any one of which could prove destabilising to a species like ours, a species that takes centuries to process ideas that threaten our reigning cosmological ideas.\nHas the cosmic case for human extinction ever been more lucidly presented?” ~ Nick Lands comments on Pythia"

The six mass extinctions and the subsequent re-flourishing of life post these incidents indicates to the universal behaviour of complex adaptive systems. A crucial factor (climate change, meteors, geological change) approaches a point in singularity (where the rate of change is undefined) the complex adaptive system of biological evolution approaches a near zero critical point. While there is an attempt to introduce changes, none of them last to become adaptations, since they are unable to keep up with the rapid rate of change. This point is one of stable or partial equilibrium. The resulting stagnation caused by the equilibrium causes degradation, since survival in a dynamic system is dependent on adaptation. This degradation takes form as a mass extinction. However, this mass extinction ends and disparate forms of life begin to re-populate the earth. This demonstrates that either singularities aren’t absolute and that complex adaptive systems continue in relevance despite severe setbacks.”2\nComplexity Economics in a Technological Singularity ParadigmComplexity Economics in a Technological Singularity Paradigm"

It is hard to compete with advances of that size, no matter how good our movies and kitchen appliances become.”\nNow they are trying to get me to join the bandwagon? “This all presents a compelling opportunity. Given its nascent state and the lack of serious full-time Progress Studies researchers, we–meaning anyone reading this document, meaning you–each have good odds of being able to substantially shape the course of this field. 25 How should we approach field-building? One approach is straightforward: publish good research, then label it Progress Studies, and simply assert that it is part of a new intellectual tradition. In contrast, my work here thus entails the beginning of an even more straightforward approach: 1. Robustly argue for foundational assumptions 2. Define operationalizations of key concepts 3. Set and enforce epistemic norms”\nQuite tempting actually.\n\n\nOur World in Data\nhas tonnes of stuff and are generally the best combination of gung-ho and data-heavy.\nSee the thread about drama with Justin Hickel for some relevant (and juicy) context.\n\n\nAgainst Wage Stagnation\nI would say that a huge amount of focus is placed on the situation in the US. There is some sense to this since they are leading the charge in GDP, but it should not be over-emphasized.\nReview\n\n\nDevelopment\nI read a lot about development. I want to organize my thoughts and my reading about this a little better.\n\n\nEconomic Growth\nAgain and again I see the idea that economic growth is good, that it drags people out of poverty, that it improves quality of life.\nMore importantly, it often seems like all the things that people want correlate with economic growth. So, even if you are unsatisfied with it as a metric for human wellbeing or happiness or anything else, finding another way of measuring what you ‘really want’ would be a waste of time because GDP already measures what you think you really want to measure. And there is already a tonne of research literature about it, so trying to create a new index and create a new body of literature on your new, improved index would be a huge waste of time.\nOf course if you can invent a wellbeing index that doesn’t correlate strongly with GDP then you will have something significant. But such a thing doesn’t seem to exist.\nHere is a good article that covers a lot of this stuff quite nicely: Economic Growth in 5 Figures.\nThere are also various things from eg. Our World in Data that cover this.\n\n\nThe issue\nThe issue is, many of my dear friends seem to disagree about this. But whenever I try to get to the heart of the disagreement, I get lost.\n\n\nCurrent work\nRead Donna Haraway’s Staying With the Trouble and try to see where the biggest points of difference between my worldview and hers are.\n\n\nOther reading\nI want to read Caliban and the Witch again, I have important disagreements with some of it. I want to read some books by Iam Morris. Though they seem to be largely things I would agree with, I want to check my methods and facts."

This one can be fleshed out in mor edetail at any point.\nAnother one I am fond of, but need to more research into to recall the exact science behind it is Glowing Zebra Women. There was something about the X chromosome during development, where there end up being these 1 inch bands all across womens bodies of genetically disctinct cell types. Need to find out the details.\nOrnamental beetles. The colors are obvious. Other features that can be nice would be:\n\n\nthe general beetles would be motionless, and just grip onto fabrics. However it might be nice to have beetles that move uphill or towards a particular color light. Very very slowly.\nthey are generally flightless as well, but they could be engineered to spontaneously fly up for a few inches and down again every hour or so."

    "text": "getting started in alignment research might take some time, Im guessing 6-24 months depending on your background and how muhc time you dedicate. Here are some examples of things you could spend time on. Nothing on this list is a requirement, nor are you expected to do all this. These are just examples of things that you could spend time on. - Use this website to keep track of opportunities. Apply liberally, dont expect to get accepted to the majority of things. Other sources (will overlap): - https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/opportunities - AI safety support slack #opportunities channel - Do the AGISF. The curriciulum is open, so you can do it by your own or with a friend. - Probably will want to learn some practical ML. This Course I reccomend. - spend a minority of time reading stuff on alignment forum / lesswrong that you find interesting. Start building an inside model - Use the AI safety support resources: They have a newsletter, a list of resources. Furthermore, you can read JJ’s posts on “Getting started independently in AI safety” and “The application is not the applicant”. - I reccomend the https://alignmentjam.com/ hackathons if you wanna get started doing something. Might need some ML first. - General skillbuilding is great if you enjoy it. Doing supervised research or internship can be a good use of your time even if its non-alignment related. - Take care of yourself. Spend as much time on these things as you find fun/interesting/meaningful and can afford and no more :)\n\nBibliography\nTaskonomy"
