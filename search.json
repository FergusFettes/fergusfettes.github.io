The room I took was vacated hastily due to a stabbing in the neighboring room. Perhaps 30 or 40 people lived there, some in apartments, some (like me) in rooms that opened onto the corridors generally, using some of the shared toilets and bathrooms in the building. The shared rooms often lacked luxuries like glass in the panes or locking doors. An example anecodte of many– when I moved in, the kitchen had recently been inexplicably cleaned. Someone had cooked a pot of cabbage. Over the course of the next six months, the pot of cabbage didn’t move– while different generations, different species of mould battled for dominance over the interior, first a luxuriant green furry mould, then lower-profiled blues came in and held sway. I went in there every morning at 6am to boil a liter of water for my daily thermos of coffee, but apart from that limited my contact with the surfaces and spaces. ### Merseburger 95 Moved in with my partner2 for a few months. However she enjoyed having more space, so I soon tried to find ‘alternative’ accomodation. ### Factory behind Lidl Moved into an abandoned factory with a friend. We had a little camping gear and found a nice building made of wood, amongst the trees. Somehow, incredibly, he couldn’t keep the place clean– despite there being an enormous hole in the floor where we could just toss rubbish. This was beyond him. ### Dannis House Moved in with an old street musician. This was a litany of small communication disasters. ### Henrietten Str. Moved to a very regular WG. Was finishing my masters at the time and therefore quite focussed. ### Merseburger 95 A room opened up in my partners flat and I took it. I stayed there for a year or so after that, my longest stay since merse 108."

    "text": "In order to get a new perspective on welfare, and taking a cue from Butler1, here I will review reasons to kill.\nTODO: make a set of metrics to judge these by, make a graph.\n\nSustenance [0.1]\nTo kill for food?\nThis justification dropped off a cliff during the agricultural revolution– at least w.r.t land animals.\nFor sea creatures I would argue that the justification for killing for eating continued at pace until the industrial revolution.\nThe reason sea creatures still merit our violent attentions is that they harvest food from all over the ocean and bring it to the shore, where we can harvest it. It is in this role as transporters of food that they earn their violence.\nThis also provides an interesting lens onto an ancient justification for hunting in general, before the majority of our environment was turned over to human activities– imagining wild animals move in a Brownian fashion, if a hunter-gatherer band sits in one place on the map and captures all wild animals that come their way, they are effectively expanding the plant capture area– especially considering wild animals often process food that is inedible for humans.\nHowever, the same could be said for land animals in certain communities. Eg. in agricultural communities, a diet supplemented with a bit of hunted and foraged food would be much richer than what agriculture alone could sustain.\nSo this probably retained some validity until well into the modern era– especially during eg. wartime periods.\n\n\nShelter [0.01]\nTo kill for clothing?\nThis has doubtless had some validity in certain places and times. It seems clear though that we can substitute very well for animal products in most places, since industrialization.\n\n\nPreference [0.001]\nTo kill for pleasure?\nHard to justify, especially since the advent of writing. Even before that we had art and poetry– there are other ways to entertain yourself.\nNote however the way preference interacts with eg. shelter– wearing real furs, no longer necessary, has social cache because eg. wearing the richest furs would have been a symbol of wealth and power since the early days of humanity, esp. in colder regions. You can see many evolutionary adaptations playing out in fashion in places like Moscow.\n\n\nConflict [0.6]\nThere are cases where the livelihood of animals is in direct conflict with the livelihood of persons2. An obvious example would be mosquitoes– whose livelihood is considered so irrelevant that we are seriously considering eliminating entire species. And we have successfully removed them en mass from eg. Taipei and other tropical cities where they would naturally thrive. Perhaps more interesting is the case of Seagulls and Pigeons, and other uneasy synanthropes– they would doubtless thrive even better if we didn’t build to exclude them, and aside from the corrosive effect of their shit, they don’t seem to do much harm. Maybe opening up cities to birds again would be an easy win for ‘wild animal’ welfare.\nWho else do we compete with directly these days? We prefer our shipping routes to the welfare of whales, and many other such conveniences. But most of the conflicts we have with animals seem to be agricultural. See for example Regenesis for a gloss of the research on wild animal-human encounters in national parks in Europe (w.r.t the question if we can’t live in harmony with wolves or boars).\n\n\nResearch [???]\nWe use animals for research. We use them to learn about the natural world, and to advance medicine in particular.\nThis subject has been treated in some detail by researchers already. TODO: read some relevant papers.\n\n\nIndustry\nAnimal products provide essential components in many industries. I think this topic would require the most careful scrutiny, as the question of relevant trade-offs in different cases might be quite nuanced. For example, if there is an animal product that is vastly more efficient to harvest than it takes to produce a substitute, how do we balance the choice?\n\n\nSport\nSee Section 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nread this↩︎\nOn a larger scale this includes most agriculture of course, but here we are talking even more directly.↩︎"

My most lasting impression was this: why do so many young Europeans who want to experience the exotic, fly all the way to Mumbai or Delhi, when there is this fabulous exotic beast of a city right on their doorstep? It was shocking how close we were to home– the reason we ended up there was the consistently cheap tickets to Sharm-El-Sheik from anywhere in europe– and yet how far we felt.\nI suppose I have always had a clear association with flying east. The 8 hours you spend crossing continents makes you feel like you are suitably far away. So flying what felt like ‘just across the pond’ and yet being somewhere so radically different– interesting!\nNote on the map, I downloaded my historical data from google maps, but unfortunately it was not as high resolution as I expected. A little disappointing, and I have now started using the OSM tracker, for future travel I will have better traces."

It is something like the highest-density, fastest-growing, youngest population in town. In a phrase, ‘the poor district’. We were asked many times what we were doing there, and told by many people it was dangerous. But, when we met some Expats in a bar in the center, one of them was from Aberdeen– they were all surprised at where we were staying, but when I asked him ‘but, do you really think it is more dangerous than Aberdeen or Glasgow’ he looked offended at the question and said ‘well of course not’.\nEverything is relative, and it is clear that the crime rates in Egypt are very moderate. To us, the district seemed exactly as it was– bustling with youthful exuberance– the transport in the district consisted almost entirely of teenagers in motorized tuktuks with ghetto blasters and LEDs drinking Pepsi, cruising. They were mostly indifferent to our presence– we would ask them to take us somewhere, they would look at one another, laugh, shrug and start driving.\n\n\nHotel Zamalek, and Downtown\n\n\nPyramids of Giza"

It is a mix of carbs: rice, lentils, macaroni and chickpeas. But it isn’t all carbs! It’s also performance. Lets say you got the takeaway; once you have your mass of carbs (in a little grease-paper bowl, like a regular noodle box), you are also given the following: one large baggie of tomato sauce, one baggie of spicy sauce, one baggie of garlic sauce, and a baggy of fried onions.\nThe fun is in pouring your ingredients one after another onto your base, and then sprinkling the onions on top, and then consuming it in the fastest way possible.\n\n\nSandwiches\nWhile I do miss the koshary, for me the sandwiches were the real deal. In imagining them, start with a falafel sandwich. This is actually one of the options, and in many was similar (though superior) to what you would find in europe. Now however, I want you to shrink down the size of the piece of bread considerably, and I want you to remove all the contents, and replace it instead with one of the following: mashed potatoes, foul (refried kidney beans), fried aubergines, fried courgette, shakshuka– or one of the other options that I don’t know how to identify. So you have your tiny sandwhich with a little bit of friend beans inside it– eat it and have another! Order five if you like, they are cheap as chips and designed for fast, efficient, standing snacking– worthy of Mumbai.\nWalk on, don’t worry– you will see another sandwich place!

We did what you are meant to do in these places, we ordered a room and stayed there for a week, forming a friendly, nodding acquaintance with the concierge and feeling like we were in a classic movie.

    "text": "Do\nSee the pyramids! When I was first in Cairo I refused, or was too stoned and confused and suffering from akathisia or depressed or whatever you are at 20 years old when you haven’t really woken up yet. Well, not this time!\nVictoria wanted to go there and I said, ‘okay, but lets do it properly’. I knew it would be something of a horrorshow, with the skallys and hawkers and hustlers– shafting tourists is practically a national sport in Egypt3– so I thought we should spend at least a day hovering around the district to get the smell of the air. In the end, it was even better– we got a small hotel overlooking the compound and had a whole week basking in the ineffable glory of those monuments. What a place! Things are even stranger than you expect– you understand of course that there are still communities– travellers, performers, poorer districts in Ireland where the horse is still present, but the reality of this in a place like Giza is far odder than you would think.3 That is not to say that it is dangerous! Here are the brass tacks: in Egypt they are unlikely to assault or rob you as a tourist, but that does not meant that they will treat you with dignity and respect at every turn! In particular, the art of finding the ‘right price’ for things– and consistently getting it, requires constant work– a quick eye, a sharp wit, a good ear– and a mean streak! Because even if you do figure out the right price and some tricks for getting them, you then have to battle with your conscience– do you really want that tea and shisha for less than a dollar, when your monthly income is likely the same as they make in a year? (Short answer, its complicated– yes, often you do want the local price just on principle, but sometimes I find myself wishing I had lost the battle of the wits and gotten shafted a little harder. A delicious samosa in Mumbai from a kind hearted young man that set me back 10p was one of these occasions.)\nLet me set it up for you: in the Pyramids Complex– a patch of desert surrounded on all sides by a 10m high concrete wall topped with a 4m wire fence containing several pyramids and archeological sites and a deeply unpleasant, presumably 5-star restaurant– there are tourists with thier guides, and there are locals with their horses and camels. The tourists on tours are being sheparded by their guides and kept safe, but there are also roaving bands of lone tourists, all of whom are taxonomically designated as customers for the locals with their horses and camels. The selling of horse and camel rides through the Pyramids Complex seems to be the chief way that the locals benefit economically from their location. This setup, already familiar to me, seemed to my imagination as a classic High Octane Bad Vibe of the tourist-trap variety, and I was not eager to play the role that the locals would obviously want me to play. But enough about me– what I wanted to talk about was, what this setup does for local society. There is a second way in which locals benefit from the pyramids– they run guest houses. We stayed in one and it was very pleasant. But I get the impression that the number of people who hang around in Giza is slim. So what is left is a relatively impoverished district, literally in the shadow of one of the most stunning objects on the earth (and I have seen some things in my time), which has an economic incentive to handle large quantities of camels and horses.\nWhat I’m getting at here is that the entire district is an extended, sprawling stables. As a farm boy, this was very endearing to me, and I thoroughly enjoyed waking up to the sound of horses galloping in groups past my window. I enjoyed walking through the stable district 100m along the road from our guesthouse. I enjoyed the gangs of pre-teens you would occasionally see who had commandeered a carriage for the evening, barging around the streets with wild abandon. But most of all, I enjoyed the surly, 20-something Arab men who would cruise around town on horseback. This was something I never expected to enjoy so much, and never knew that I had missed! Until I saw it in Giza.\nTo give just a bit more context, if you walked for 8 or 9 minutes away from the Complex you would enter Giza proper. The area immediately around the Pyramids is exactly that sort of bizzaro-world that exists in third world countries around UNESCO sites, where the enormity of global inequality is most present, most palpable– and through which veil, one presumes (or one presumes the poor people in the area presume), a person could at these sites most easily pass. The shops have crazy prices and are run by increasingly villainous individuals the closer you get to the gate4. The sheer evil that flickered in the eye of the man who sold me a liter of water for two dollars 50m from the gate– was worth it of course, for the lesson in the shapes and forms of darkness. But if you turn away and walk into Giza, very quickly you will come across a highway, and once you have crossed that highway you are in a very regular part of Cairo. Poor but pround, happy to see you, strange sites on every corner.4 Exemplified most exquisitely by the KFC that sites directly across from the entrance to the complex– a glowing obelisk of the capitalocene facing off against eternity.\nVery regular except– for the young men on horseback.\nIt was beautiful to me not just because seeing people on horses doing regular people stuff, hanging out, going about the place, seemed like something that all humans should see– its something that was in our culture for millenia, and its a tragedy that we have lost it. But it was also an amusing and deeply characterful lesson in the force of– what to call it, inequality, situations, contingency. That this young man here, on this motorway divider, should be riding a horse about the place as if it was the most regular thing in the world– was due to the fact that tourists found it appropriate to see the pyramids from horseback, and had the cash to actualise their fantasies– and that this was so present, and so consistent that an entire community had grown around the pyramids, a large community of people who, against all odds, in a megacity populated in parts by teenagers in tuktuks high on pepsi, so lost was it in the stream of technofuturism– that here would be the first time I saw regular folks doing people stuff on horseback. Funny.\nThe story of the pyramids itself– a great place really– I will leave for another time."

    "text": "Economic Growth\nI read conflicting views about this and tried to do a deeper dive by reading Harrawy and a textbook on Degrowth. I found the degrowth stuff quite unconvincing.\n\nEconomic Growth in Five Figures Lant Pritchett 1\nThis has some good graphs that summarize the situation pretty thoroughly.\n\n\nThe Moral Foundations of Progress 0\nGood links to general stuff.\n“Our technological advancements used to entail new antibiotics, reductions in child mortality, and the capacity for self-determination. It is hard to compete with advances of that size, no matter how good our movies and kitchen appliances become.”\nNow they are trying to get me to join the bandwagon? “This all presents a compelling opportunity. Given its nascent state and the lack of serious full-time Progress Studies researchers, we–meaning anyone reading this document, meaning you–each have good odds of being able to substantially shape the course of this field. 25 How should we approach field-building? One approach is straightforward: publish good research, then label it Progress Studies, and simply assert that it is part of a new intellectual tradition. In contrast, my work here thus entails the beginning of an even more straightforward approach: 1. Robustly argue for foundational assumptions 2. Define operationalizations of key concepts 3. Set and enforce epistemic norms”\nQuite tempting actually.\n\n\nOur World in Data\nhas tonnes of stuff and are generally the best combination of gung-ho and data-heavy.\nSee the thread about drama with Justin Hickel for some relevant (and juicy) context.\n\n\nAgainst Wage Stagnation\nI would say that a huge amount of focus is placed on the situation in the US. There is some sense to this since they are leading the charge in GDP, but it should not be over-emphasized.\nReview\n\n\nDevelopment\nI read a lot about development. I want to organize my thoughts and my reading about this a little better.\n\n\nEconomic Growth\nAgain and again I see the idea that economic growth is good, that it drags people out of poverty, that it improves quality of life.\nMore importantly, it often seems like all the things that people want correlate with economic growth. So, even if you are unsatisfied with it as a metric for human wellbeing or happiness or anything else, finding another way of measuring what you ‘really want’ would be a waste of time because GDP already measures what you think you really want to measure. And there is already a tonne of research literature about it, so trying to create a new index and create a new body of literature on your new, improved index would be a huge waste of time.\nOf course if you can invent a wellbeing index that doesn’t correlate strongly with GDP then you will have something significant. But such a thing doesn’t seem to exist.\nHere is a good article that covers a lot of this stuff quite nicely: Economic Growth in 5 Figures.\nThere are also various things from eg. Our World in Data that cover this.\n\n\nThe issue\nThe issue is, many of my dear friends seem to disagree about this. But whenever I try to get to the heart of the disagreement, I get lost.\n\n\nCurrent work\nRead Donna Haraway’s Staying With the Trouble and try to see where the biggest points of difference between my worldview and hers are.\n\n\nOther reading\nI want to read Caliban and the Witch again, I have important disagreements with some of it. I want to read some books by Iam Morris. Though they seem to be largely things I would agree with, I want to check my methods and facts."

    "text": "Not having ‘graduated highschool’ (not that that means anything, as I later would argue in Leipzig), I was left with limited choices for legitimizing myself in the eyes of society. This was, by this point, something I was increasingly interested in doing. Thankfully there were two universities in Scotland that had a ‘summer school for access’ programm– Aberdeen and Dundee. To Aberdeen I could commute etc., so I was packed off there.\nThe summer school was a wonderful farce, where all the oddballs of the world were sandwiched together into an improbably collective. It wasn’t just people who had left the system, like me, but also foreign students, older students, people wanting to change to radically different programms. A great collection of oddballs and we had a good time of it.\n\n\n\nI decided to study Maths with Chemistry, as I thought that sounded high-minded but yet practical. Unfortunately, having stopped engaging with education approximately a decade earlier, I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about in the introductory maths classes and soon dropped out. The only thing I went to in my first year was the chemistry labs, which were very fun– I had a great benchmate to crack jokes with, and would always fiddle my way through the protocol with a fair amount of flair and alacritty. I always finished an hour before everyone else, and not always because I cooked my books.\n\n\n\nThe few classes I went to in my seconds year (after switching majors) were dissapointing. The psychology class was just a room filled with 200 teenagers that did not give a fuck.\nI’m hardly one to ciriticize, but at this point I had decided I needed to start shaping up, so I was dissapointed. Probably they reflected my own tardiness and incompetence in the worst possible way.\n\n\n\n\nAfter two years in Aberdeen I had had enough, and had to hit the road. If I was better behaved I could of course have done erasmus, studied abroad, etc etc. But I was still a half-conscious idiot and couldn’t behave. I transferred to the Open University, the university for wild oddballs with no money or sense. They let me skip the first year on the meager credits I scraped together from Aberdeen, and the course was only three years total. Hurrah– something I could manage.\n\n\nThe course was physics. I think some part of me still saw the endeavour as something like ‘get the most prestigious degree you can with the least possible effort’, and Physics sounded suitable. I think I believed I could get through it unscathed. I was wrong.\nI cannot stress this enough: a serious study program will change you[^magnified].\n[^magnified] The effect is of course magnified by the fact that you understake your studies at a particularly dramatic point in your development– though personally speaking, I was 25 at this point, so would have been over the development hump.\nThe second year was a deeply religious experience. I will write about it im more length at some point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to speak to the head of studies at the Chemistry department to ask if I could do a Masters in Chemistry with them. He said found this absurd and hilarious.\n\n\n\nI studied Physics in Leipzig for two years. It was, in many important ways, the most fullfilling time of my life. However, it was also incredibly draining– remember, I was competing with people who had come there directly from a decade of continuous mathematics education, in German universities. I was a degenerate wanderer who was kicked out of school at the age of 15. I had to push myself further than I ever imagined I would. I learned a great deal, about my limits and my capacities, and about physics.\nTwo professors offered me PhD positions. I turned them down, and fled, ashamed, to the road. 5 days after my final defence I was in India."

Life, they say, should be gauged on a continuum, and not granted according to a binary decision. A rock would certainly be low on any continuum of aliveness, and a dog, a tree, and a human being would rank highly. More ambiguous systems would fall in a middleregion of semialiveness—somewhere below bacteria, which almost ev- eryone agrees are alive, and somewhere above rocks. Viruses, which some biologists consider living and others do not, would reside in the upper reaches of this middle ground. Below that would be complexsystems that no one really considers to be alive but that display some behaviors consistent with living organisms—things such as the economy and automobiles. The PolyWorld organisms would fall somewhere be- tween Chevrolets and the flu. There is a particular advantage in regard- ing life in this manner: using systems that no one would classify as truly alive, biologists could nonetheless isolate the qualities of life."

It’s actually quite different from what I expected. I mean I know I listen to a lot of solo piano music, but that is a little absurd. And how did John Cale get in there as second!\nThe more I look at that list the more perplexing I find it. I guess I did download a lot of music this year and listen to it on my laptop, so the numbers are quite a bit skewed by that. But that still means that I have listened to 16h or the Polyrythmic Orchestra of Cotonou!\nThe only thing I find totally unrealistic is the 12h of Brahms and the 8h of Beethoven– they must both be from the Menuhin Century album– the ‘Virtuoso and Landmark Recordings’ CDs are full of Brahms and Beethoven, and I listen to it regularly. But in my defense I’m mostly in it for the Menuhin– those two plus the Shostakovich– and maybe even the Rachmaninoff? I think there are a few names on there because of that album.\n\nPodcasts\nHere are the top podcast times:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf = sort_df_by_artist_time(podcast_df)\ndf.head(30).style.hide_index()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Artist\n      Time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      80,000 Hours Podcast with Rob Wiblin\n      23h:20m\n    \n    \n      Conversations with Tyler\n      17h:21m\n    \n    \n      The Ezra Klein Show\n      10h:30m\n    \n    \n      Dan Carlin's Hardcore History\n      10h:12m\n    \n    \n      The Lunar Society\n      4h:12m\n    \n    \n      Sean Carroll's Mindscape: Science, Society, Philosophy, Culture, Arts, and Ideas\n      1h:57m\n    \n    \n      Lex Fridman Podcast\n      1h:26m"

    "text": "Top Tracks\nOkay, now things are starting to fall into place. A lot of the hours that Liszt has racked up are due to the album ‘Harmonies poétiques et religieuses’, which, I have to admit, has failed to really hit home with me. I spent many hours with the album, as you can see, because I have had good luck with other long Liszt suites (such as the Annees), just by listening to them again and again until they start to sink in. But the Harmonies still haven’t settled in, in fact I hardly remember them, which is why I was so surprised that Liszt was so high on the numbers for the last year.\nLo-Pacific by the Sun City Girls is great, but is an entire album as a single track so is cheating a little bit.\nWhat is Kansas by Opinion? I have never heard of that. Apparently it is on a playlist I created though, so apparently I listened to it and liked it once upon a time– or rather, 4 times upon a time, since it is 30 mins long. I’ll drop it too.\nIf I remove the classical stuff and Lo-Pacific, then the top tracks looks like this:\n\nTop Tracks (All)Top Tracks (Non-Classical)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf = sort_df_by_track(listening_df)\n\n# Show columns in the order 'Track', 'Artist', 'Time'\ndf = df[['Track', 'Artist', 'Time']]\ndf.head(30).style.hide_index()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Track\n      Artist\n      Time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \"J\" Blues 72\n      Shin Joong Hyun\n      3h:36m\n    \n    \n      Harmonies poétiques et religieuses, S. 173: III.

    "text": "Computer Programmer (Python Developer)\nThe title of this section is a joke, due to this unfortunate interaction\n[whatsapp-python-developer][image]\nwhich lead to one of the most thoroughgoing dressing-downs I have ever recieved from someone ten years my junior. It was in one of my wilder summers1 when I was frequenting the afterparies of Impulstanz Festival in Vienna. The individual with whom I had been texting told me with an intense and terrifying mix of fondness and fury that that was not a good response to a question about what one does– not a good way of continuing a conversation. To give you a flavour of her assaults, near the end of the evening she was getting into a taxi mid-rant and pointed at a friend who knew the address of the next location and then at us saying ‘these motherfuckers are coming to the afterparty’ without a trace of delicacy. Presumably we were coming there for a grilling.\nIn any case, I do indeed program computers. And while I nominally do so using python, I am also increasingly comfortable with bash, with markdown, with SQL[^Postgres– see my tips folder.], and with those weird pseudo-DSLs that are basically glorified config files– I’m basically talking about YAML of course– that constitute much of the ‘DevOps’ lifecycle. I also, though I am not proud of this, occasionally click my way through a maze of AWS screens, though I prefer to do that sort of thing in terraform when I can (or bash).\n\nONDEWO\n\nHistory\nWow, what a place! This was my first job as an actual software engineer, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity, the experience, and for setting a low bar for all my future bosses to rise above!\nI need to address that first. The boss at ONDEWO was quite the man. He was credentialled, hard-working, and determined. He was also really quite talented at finding talent! The team, when I arrived, was quite cool, lots of very intelligent people doing interesting work. And he chose a solid problem to work on. I really believe it could have all worked out actually, and he could have had his dream of being an Austrian Unicorn. Alas! It was not to be! Sometimes my heart bleeds a little for him.\nBut for the little, really quite tiny, microscopic even, cracks in the edifice. It was not all right. In fact it was quite wrong, and the subtle ways in which if failed to obtain, again and again, showed through– the cracks widened– the edifice crubled. All that really happened was, he was not straightforward. All that happened was, he treated his employees to the smae bullshit that he treated prospective customers. He was fundamentally, achingly dishonest, hard to trust or to like, and his manipulations were too obvious (and therefore odious). I think if he had been more direct and open with his employees, if he had managed to ‘turn off’ his modus operandi every now and then and communicate with us individually, with anyone, it could have worked. But I don’t think anyone got through to him.\nThe classic story happened. One of his highest-up quit, and over the next two years so did everyone else. It was very obvious what was happening, as it was happening. The entire drama played out with that deeply moving sense of historical inevitability– you felt like you were watching one of the great dramas, a tragicomedy.\nThere isn’t much more to say on the timelines. I worked incrdibly hard, I don’t know how much if I include all the evenings reading blogs and tutorials on the internet. Fully 50 hours a week in the office, but and extra 10-30 a week of reading I suspect. There was a time when I was also coding on the weekends, but I started getting muscle cramps in my forearms, and thankfully noticed and stopped in time. In fact I spent some weeks trying not to use my arms at all when I was not at work, there were strange motions under the surface, my muscles were not happy, and I am very thankful that I am blessed with enough proprioception to notice this soon enough to manage it.\n\n\nTech\nI was a python developer.

I had to wrestle with a huge, old python2 library, and try to turn it into something useable.\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\nHypermile\nI am currently working in a tech startup that is working in the vehicle automation space. We would probably like to one day make self-driving trucks– but in the meantime2 we are working on AI-powered advanced cruise control for making truckers lives more comfortable and more energy efficient– and more interestingly (and more immediately for myself personally) providing a large amount of data for use to learn from, train on, and generally play with."

    "text": "Alacritty is one of the many lovely developer tools that are springing up as the first flush in the Rust revolution. Its a fantastic terminal that I’m sure I will have more to say about in due time.\nAs noted, I discovered something lovely while transferring some files the other day. I was moving my small film collection (currently stretching to 7 titles: <INSERT FILMS>) from one computer to another, and I just wanted to sanity check that the transfer had succeeded. So I sshed into the machine ssh work and ran vlc -I dummy ~/films/Mullholland\\ Dr.mkv.\nImagine my surprise to see the criterion logo appear, animated before me. Here is a nice still from another film to illustrate: \nYou can also look at a copy-paste of the terminal here to prove that it really is ASCII output.\n\nZooming out, the resolution becomes better and better (text), but it starts to jitter quite badly at a certain size. \nI thought the ssh connection might be a bottleneck, so I went to the computer to try it on one machine. I had that slightly haunted feeling that the magic might disappear, and when I entered the terminal I suddenly wondered >How will I get it to work here? If I run vlc -I dummy ~/filmes/Crash.mkv I’ll just get a window.\nbut as soon as the thought was there I realised I could just start with ssh localhost. And it worked. I was watching the ‘Universal’ logo barge into my terminal.\nBut things got even better. I noticed that my keystrokes were even getting sent back to vlc, so I could skip forward, pause and even quit the film (sometimes it gets stuck and I have to killall vlc but so it goes).\nAfter a little sleuthing, I notice that\nvlc -I dummy ~/films/film.choice\nis interactive, but\nvlc ~/films/film.choice\nis not. What is this dummy terminal doing after all? Well, the vlc wiki has a little info[^vlc dummy], and they nicely point out that keystrokes are sent back. I find the terminology a little odd, since ‘dummy video output’ is just normal video output, but I think they are looking at it from a gui-makers perspective. And this seems to be the key– with the dummy interface, vlc streams the movie to a window. Alacritty is presumably pretending to be a screen or a window of some sort, in order to pass its work to the GPU, so VLC merrily dumps the video stream in there.\nWhat I would love to know, and I might take some time to investigate, is how is Alacritty mapping the video stream to ASCII? And why?\n\nI will leave this story here for now. I have two things in mind: one, to investigate further over at the Alacritty github and two, to have some people round for a film, run it through Alacritty-ASCII and run the audio through a digital soundcard or some synths, and make a little performance. I’ll update if either of these things transpire.\nIn the meantime, if you want to try it yourself, I have uploaded a slightly rushed video of the effect in action (the size limit on asciinema was not made with 4k ASCII movies in mind, so no hard feelings). Asciinema cast attached1.\nAnd here is a final zoomed in still to admire. In the attached text you can see how much of a difference the color makes, presumably a lot of the 8s have the same foreground and background color.\n\n\n\n\n\nmuscle kid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nhttps://asciinema.org/a/378193 [^vlc dummy]: https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/dummy/↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m going to mirror my blog in Hyperspace (aka the backend of the Beaker browser, if you don’t know about it I suggest you check that out first).\nTo do this, I’m going to try setting up my free micro instance1 in the gcloud as a hyperdrive host.\n\nHyperdrive Host\nI’ve had trouble doing big installs on a micro instance before. For reference, here are the specs of a micro instance:\n\n\n\nRAM\nCores\nMem\n\n\n\n\n0.6GB\n0.2 (aka a shared core!)\n32GB\n\n\n\nI run my ansible script against it, and it dies. I try to install and run a docker image, it dies. It is not made for grand works. Or even minor works.\nSo in order to get everything nicely installed and prepared I decided to make a ‘standard simple computer’. This is a decently-proportioned machine I can run in the cloud for generating snapshots that can be used as the base image for smaller, gentler machines. It does all the installations without crashing.\nI also used the opportunity to try out a preemptible instance. This is an instance that google can kill whenever, and is about 3x cheaper than a normal machine. Since I am just running this machine to do little tasks in the cloud, I don’t care if it gets killed sometimes. However, I didn’t realise that my free cloud credits can’t be used for preemptible instances, I only found this out after. This means– shock horror! I will actually get billed for this usage. Lets see how much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSKU\nService\nUsage\nCost\n\n\n\n\nPreemptible E2 Instance Core running in Americas\nCompute Engine\n1.63 hour\n€0.01\n\n\nPreemptible E2 Instance Ram running in Americas\nCompute Engine\n6.5 gibibyte hour\n€0.00\n\n\n\nOkay not too terrible.\nSo now I have a snapshot with some basic things installed, I can try running a hyperdrive host. Obviously I don’t need all my command-line tools and everything to really run it, but its nice to have this snapshot available for future machines. And when I get it all running stably, I can create a minimal snapshot with only the server I want so it runs more smoothly.\nTo make my hyperdrive, I’m just going to open up the Beaker browser and see how it is these days, it’s been almost six months since I used it and it’s developing rapidly. Oh! They have a ‘create hyperdrive from git repo’ button now! This gets better and better.\nSo I’m now hosted on the Beaker network. URL.\nOkay so it seems the way Hugo generates sites, based on the CNAME that I supplied, means that all the links from the frontpage on beaker go straight to the clearnet version at www.fergusfettes.com. This is slightly annoying but I’ll not work on it now, since all the rest of the stuff is actually there, it just isn’t linked correctly. This post on the hyperspace, for example.\nAnother thing to note, is I would need to host all the images in hyperspace too to be really complete. However, as it is now, it is a great demonstration of how nicely the hyper protocol interacts with http.\nSo now I’m restarting my micro instance with the hyperdrive installed. Starting hyperspace (hyperspace start), and hyperdrive (hyperdrive start). Playing around with the hyperdrive cli, I can get info about my local hyperdrvie once I have cd’ed into it: cd Hyperdrive; hyperdrive info --root.\nNow I’ll try mounting the hyperdrive that was created on my laptop by the Beaker browser. I copy the URL ID (aka. without the ‘hyper://’) and serve it with\nhyperdrive mount cb8bb0fdb843f78267df2dce7c4dd3cb4fd89a9b16c4454912691a73e5d1c737\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/cb8bb0fdb843f78267df2dce7c4dd3cb4fd89a9b16c4454912691a73e5d1c737\n(after the mount there is handy output telling you what to do next :D).\nHaving a look around the beaker user list, I found my first attempt at a beaker blog is still being hosted (I’m @frgnym)! I feel so touched! Someone out there is still on my website! I’ll seed it too:\nhyperdrive mount c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nOkay awesome. I’m not only newly mirrored on the hyper network, my old website is still on there. So great. That was incredibly easy. Maybe I’ll start using the beaker browser as my primary browser. (I always say that.)\nSo now my old website is hosted in three places, whoever was hosting it before, my micro instance, and the browser I am currently viewing it from. See the little three in the top right: \nAnd now this blog is hosted there too! Excellent. Now lets see how the IPFS fares!\nUPDATE: It was obviously Kicks Condor who was hosting it before, so I’m hosting their drive now too.\nUPDATE2: So, the micro host wasn’t actually working. I ran a couple tests, turns out I used the complete wrong command. I should have used the following:\nhyperdrive mount some_random_name c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/some_random_name\nThe random name doesn’t seen to affect the seeded drive. ‘hyperdrive mount X’ creates a new drive called x and creates a new key for it, so I had folders named after all my old drives with new keys and no content.\nAnyway I fixed all the mounts and now I see the IP of my micro host in the top right under the hosts. In other news, this means that there were three people hosting my old blog before, and now there are 4!\n\n\nIPFS Host\nOkay so I’ve started my small computer again and I’m going through the Command-line quickstart. Seems pretty straightforward.\nSo I dumped the contents of my dotfiles into my local IPFS node (ipfs add -r ~/dotfiles), and now I’m going to serve it and mount it. I ran the daemon (ipfs daemon) and set up an ssh tunnel to my small computer ssh -fNL 5001:localhost:5001 small-computer so I can see the IPFS dashboard at localhost:5001. Very snazzy! I can see the files I added too.\nNow I’ll get the browser plugin that lets me view IPFS files in Firefox. Actually since the install was so easy, I’ll run an IPFS node on my local laptop too. When I add my dotfiles locally, I notice that they have the same hashes as when I added them on the server. This is key to the coolest feature of the IPFS– since these files had already been added by me elsewhere, they didn’t get added again, and when I tried to add them locally the network determined this and just ‘pinned’ them as well, aka my local node automatically became a seeder of these same files. Network deduplication. This is a game-changer. Particularly in a world where things like the pypi and npm exist, where vast numbers of developer-hours are spent redoing work, it is easy to see how the notion of deduplication can be expanded to do more and more abstract kinds of energy-saving work. (Imagine writing tests for kinds of work you want code to do, and the code itself being mutable. If multiple people had done work that passed those tests, you could choose between them based on other factors like speed, efficiency etc.)\nSo anyway. Now I go to my blog, and do ipfs add -r public2, and hey presto, my blog is in the IPFS. Running on my local machine, that link redirects to the following:\nhttp://bafybeibgegkyol2e5txemzjuflbpjrsh6da2xxbyzzilahtilsp3jxxaa4.ipfs.localhost:8080/\nso it just gets the file from the local folder nice and easy. However, when I go to the same link in Chrome (where I havent installed the plugin) it loads as well without a redirect (after some time). So I think the ipfs.io acts as a temporary node, grabbing the hash you request from the network and serving it over http. Aka, it came to my local node, got the file, then gave it back to me.\nNow, the blog in the IPFS has the same issue as the one in hyperspace– all the links point to the clearnet. However this is still fine for now, and still shows nicely how the two protocols interact.\nSo now I just need to set up the host in my micro instance, and I’m done for the day. I’m going to take a risk and try to do it directly in my micro host. It’ll probably crash and die but lets see.\nI shut down some unnecessary services on the host. I’ve inited the ipfs node. And added the blog again. And started the daemon. And the node is still accessible. I shut down my local node and tried the URL again through the ipfs gateway and.. its there! I’m a little worried it’s just being cached by the ipfs gateway but I’ll check back tomorrow and see.\nNice! I’m now mirrored on two decentralized internet protocols! I’m safe in the case of nuclear apocalypse! I’m part of the future!\n\n\nConculsions\nVery cool to have finally actually used both of these protocols, I have been following and stanning them for ages now. They both exceed expectations in terms of user-friendliness and just-works-ness. Maybe thats just because I’m a programmer now so things are easier, but their install and setup instructions are really nice and clear and worked without a hitch in this case.\nObviously there are still some things I need to sort out, and some things I want to try: 1. Set up cronjobs to update all three of the hosts once per day with the latest content (I know I should use build pipelines but I have never used github pipelines and I think a little cronjob is fine for now). 2. See if it is possible to have relative paths that work in all three hosts, so internal links work properly and always link within the same protocol. 3. Have a look at hyper-ipfs inter-operability. 4. Set up nodes on a raspberry pi and serve from home.\nIn terms of updating, becaue I just dumped whatever blog I had at the time into the protocol, the version in hyper doesn’t have this post at all, and the version in IPFS has this post without the IPFS content. This needs to be fixed first. The other things will take more time and tweaking so I’ll put them on the back burner for now.\nSo! Great success! I’m off to a New Years bonfire now. Lets burn the bad 2020-vibes away.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWith the Google Cloud Platform free developer package, you get a teeny little machine in the cloud for free forever.↩︎\nI made a point of checking if hidden files are added, they aren’t by default so the .git folder should be skipped.↩︎"

So here I am just dumping all the events from the gamepads into the console:\nfunction render() {\n  session = renderer.xr.getSession();\n\n  if (session) {\n    for (let source of session.inputSources) {\n      if (source.gamepad) {\n        ProcessGamepad(source.gamepad, source.handedness);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  handleController( controller1 );\n  handleController( controller2 );\n\n  renderer.render( scene, camera );\n}\n\n\nfunction ProcessGamepad(gamepad, hand, pose) {\n  console.log(hand)\n  update_state(gamepad)\n};\n\nfunction update_state (gamepad) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < gamepad.buttons.length; ++i) {\n    if (gamepad.buttons[i].pressed){\n      console.log('button pressed: ' + i + ', value: ' + gamepad.buttons[i].value + ', touched: ' + gamepad.buttons[i].touched)\n    }\n  }\n  for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < gamepad.axes.length; i+=2, ++j) {\n    console.log(gamepad.axes[i], i + 1 < gamepad.axes.length ? gamepad.axes[i + 1] : 0);\n  }\n}\nI start it up and it works! My Oculus controller has buttons 0, 1, 4 and 5, and 3 is the joystick click. I assume 2 is reseved for the oculus button on the right controller, though maybe I can use it on the left one. It also has sensitive axes on buttons 0 and 1, and the joystick. Plus position information! A veritable wealth of possibilities.\nI’ll continue with this tomorrow."

I looks like there was a major boom in VR about five years ago, most of the libraries I’m working with were started back then. But then they seem to have somewhat petered out. Maybe we are currently in a little VR-winter, as the initial hype overshot all reality. Maybe we are heading into a thaw now. Lets see.\nFurthermore, notes after a day or two of regular Oculus useage– it definitely takes a toll on the eyes. Everything has a somewhat hallucinagenic quality when you come out of it, like an acid comedown. I’m not sure if this effect will diminish or grow with continued usage. I can see it being very problematic for people who suffer from HPPD.\nOr maybe all the Oculus Developers are elsewhere, working with the Unreal Engine or Unity or someeuch. Maybe ThreeJS isn’t cool. But I must say I am impressed by how much this thing can run, I spend 20 minutes filling my vision with layer upon layer of multicoloured swirls, without noticing any drop in quality or responsivness.\nThe next part I have to integrate is the VR answer to the dat-gui library.

But I think it is enough to have some fun with just now so I will push it to github so I can use it untethered. I’ll make it available at paint.fergusfettes.com."

In the process I stumled across some other stuff that might come in useful. At the end of the day what I need is this: * Vim Javascript Implimentation for my editor * RiftSketch for the framework * ThreeJS Editor tools stolen from here. Actually maybe I can just skip RiftSketch and add Vim and a VRButton directly to that. But I would feel bad if I left RiftSketch behind.\nAll of this mixed with my paint program of course! It’s going to be mental.\nIn all seriousness, in the short term, if I can integrate that JS Vim implementation into RiftSketch I will be a happy man.\nThis process is teaching me a great deal about JavaScript. That should go without saying. In the last hour I learned: * how to use prettier and eslint to lint my stuff * how to reverse engineer files from .maps * more about building/packaing etc (still trying to use parcel for everything since it is nice and minimal)"

enquiry, pricelist/specification plus a pdf for our Model E attached, and more detailed drawings of our standard designs than on our website on links below.  The Model E has no rain screening, decking or roof overhangs, and while there are reduced roof overhangs as standard, this is now quoted as an extra on the Model D price list (except for a 1.7m deep gable deck, which is included at the extended roof overhang).\nThe Indicative Total Cost does not include any allowance for a main contractor or project manager, as many of our customers do this themselves as self-builders.  We are well placed to provide support in doing this and in providing or facilitating provision of all the paperwork required in getting to that stage, which makes for a very cost-effective package, but we can provide a full-build service if that is sought.  Local “other trades” contractors are usually accustomed to working together and co-ordinating what they do, which can help greatly with running a house-build.  A turn-key supply adds substantially to cost as it requires a main contractor and project manager.  We can usually provide a project manager if required or supply through a main contractor (subject to agreed payment terms).\nCost will vary depending on site location, access and site conditions, but the Indicative Total Cost gives good guidance of the direct build costs.  We frequently carry out the erection of the finished shell, i.e. the house having roof finish, guttering and wall cladding completed, and the standing scaffolding removed.   Alternatively, we can erect the shell only to airtightness level.  The airtightness membrane is installed as part of this process, and the only specialist issue thereafter is ensuring it is not pierced, or where this is necessary, that this is supervised and adequately sealed. \nThe kit price includes all drawings, schedules, calculations and certification etc relating to our supply, and we are happy to provide a kit only, although if we are not providing any erection labour we would have to charge VAT on it, which is normally reclaimable for a dwelling-house.  Similarly on that basis, we normally don’t have to charge VAT if we provide some assistance with the kit erection.\nRegarding mortgageablity, the construction is compliant with the criteria of most lenders, the only exception in our experience to date is the few who won’t lend on timber clad homes.   We are category A1 NHBC housebuilders, and can carry out construction under their ten-year warranty scheme, which includes staged inspections during the build.\nWe’ll be pleased to provide any additional information you may require, and to discuss the project further with you.\nRegards\nBryan\n\n\nI’ll be back in the office later, and will email you our information pack which includes guide prices, but it has been very difficult to keep track of material prices this year.  I’ll also send you a specimen quotation which sets out our normal contract terms.  In the past we have been able to confirm the kit cost on order confirmation (which is the next stage for you following receipt of the BW), but recently all we could do was have up to date quotes for most of the required materials, then order these promptly, and identify those where this was not possible.\n\n\nWe regularly help folk fill in their mortgage application forms in regard to costs and how these are set out.  Where there is a mortgage we usually provide NHBC cover, which gives a 10 year warranty, and independent, staged inspections, otherwise you are likely to need to have the build stages inspected and certified by a chartered professional.  The cost of NHBC cover is usually around £2,000.  The self-build lenders we have mainly come across are Halifax and  the Ecological Building Society.\nThe BW requires structural design certification of the whole house, including the full design of the substructure, which allows accurate estimates to be obtained for that.  We can provide cost allowances for other trades, but the harder the information, i.e. actual estimates, the better.  Again, the BW specifies these fairly tightly.  You also need a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery (MVHR) installation due to the airtightness, and a local firm has done almost all of these in our most recent houses.  Additionally, you may need to firm up on the renewables input and heating.  This will all have been done in draft form to produce SAP calculations for the BW, but you may want to give it further thought.\nOur current lead time from order confirmation to kit deliver to site is about 14 weeks.  While we have had pre Christmas notifications of further complement price increases, I think timber prices may well soften in the New Year (they have doubled over the past 18 months!).   Concrete, and especially steel prices have shot up, along with there being supply issues, but we have costs on a current local groundworks and substructure build at Chapel of Garioch, which should be a good guide for starters.  From commencement of site works to completion usually takes about six months.  Trades overlaps add time, and that between practical completion and actual occupation alway seems to take longer than what folk plan!\n\n\nEven the simplest planning application will take six weeks to process, probably longer.  I think the main reason they are asking for this is to ensure the neighbour has been notified.\nIn terms of kit delivery, the critical supply time is normally for the windows and external doors.  This is currently about 12 weeks plus with all the usual suppliers, and another three weeks can be added to that for their July shutdown.  We don’t like to order these until the BW is issued, or at least it has been confirmed there are definitely no issues regarding the building regulations.  It would also be good to know there was no issue with the planning application to reorientate the house. >\nAlso a good move to get the extant consent confirmed as implemented, as set out by Doug.\nAn August delivery for the kit looks more likely.  The paperwork is a marathon these days, so actually erecting the houses seems a bit of a breeze by comparison!"
