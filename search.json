    "text": "In “Capitalist Realist: Is There No Alternative?” Mark Fischer asks us to join him in a depressed amble through the world we live in and our escape routes.\nIn this and much of his other work Fischer is a committed Fukuyaman– ‘The End of History’ makes the same claim– that there is no credible alternative to capitalism, and there hasn’t been since the end of WWII1.\nI have been looking for alternatives to Effective Altruism ever since I fell into its memetic gravity well2. One of the most interesting criticisms I discovered recently was simple the fact that EA has brought rationalism and cold calculation into the realm of philanthropy. Philanthropy was one of the last refuges of the spirit, where capitalism had not completely overtaken. It was a space ripe for colonization, and EA seems to have been just the discipline to do it.\nUnfortunately, via a simple conjunction of the above facts, we are left with the startling possibility that we have reached the end of philanthropy too.\nI write this becuase, as I said, I have been looking for ways out. I could also be writing it for those good souls around me who roll their eyes and tell me they are not so sure about this EA stuff. I ask them what they think, and normally get a response along the lines of ‘oof, the vibes in here’. White men. Capitalism. Neoliberals! etc.\nAs you can probably imagine, I’ve yet to be impressed by any of this."

He suggests that EA is not, in fact, taking over philanthropy.\nActually trying to find decent numbers on it, it does seem like its around a percent or so of global development grants. So still pretty small. I stand corrected."

I propose taking a lesson from this paper on energy rate density as a universal complexity metric2.2 Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver\nFor example, if we want to measure the teleonomy of a helicase, and judge how different modifications affect its ability to achieve goals, the easiest way would be to measure its energy useage/entropy production.\n“What is minimal intelligence? Generally speaking, our understanding of intelligence has to do with sets of biological functions of organisms that exhibit a degree of flexibility against contingencies in their environment-induced behavioral repertoire. In principle, sensory perception, sensory-motor coordination, basic forms of learning and memory, decision-making and problem solving, are all marks of minimal intelligence subject to scrutiny with the toolkit of the cognitive sciences. The bottom line is that an appraisal of the behavioral repertoire of eukaryotes, and of the organizational features that sustain it, resists an interpretation in reactive, non-cognitive, terms.”33 Conditions for minimal intelligence across eukaryota: a cognitive science perspective\n“Cells emerged at the very beginning of life on Earth and, in fact, are coterminous with life. They are enclosed within an excitable plasma membrane, which defines the outside and inside domains via their specific biophysical properties. Unicellular organisms, such as diverse protists and algae, still live a cellular life. However, fungi, plants, and animals evolved a multicellular existence. Recently, we have developed the cellular basis of consciousness (CBC) model, which proposes that all biological awareness, sentience and consciousness are grounded in general cell biology. Here we discuss the biomolecular structures and processes that allow for and maintain this cellular consciousness from an evolutionary perspective.”44 Biomolecular Basis of Cellular Consciousness via Subcellullar Nanobrains\n\n\nBibliography"

    "text": "The ‘Tree’ of Life\nThe most surprising thing I learned when studying the origin of life was about the structure of the root of the tree.\nThe structure of the network of evolitionary relatedness is usually imagined– and described– as ‘the tree of life’. A literal tree.\nHowever, it looks like we actually came from an incredibly strange and diverse place, and there was no Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) as is commonly understood.\n… describe it in some detail\n\n\nThe Evolution of Culture\n… obviously I need some evidence for this but …\nI think often about Babylon, and the Tower. For me, this story has always been a very specific metaphor1– about the end of the universal common language, the break between myself and others, the dividing up of humankind2. Of course I always thought that this myth referred to a mythical prehistory in which people truly understood one another, and essentially comes down to anxiety about solipsistic alienation. But I never quite appreciated the image it gives of the world post-Babylon– and, for the record, I think we must assume that we are all and ‘have always been’ post-Babylon.\n\nquote from the bible? or snow crash? or julian jaynes?\n\nBut the message that I am interested in here is not probing pre-Babylon, but post-Babylon. The post-Babylon era, the Era of Babel, the era of Diversity is what is interesting.\nI think, those of us who are very online, and have sauntered and lurked through LW, EA, 4CH, Juggaloes, MLP:FIM, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, the original SilkRoad, TOR, Twitch, DeviantArt, Rotten.com, HN, Tumblr etc. et.c can have some inkling of the diversity of ideas and opinions that can exist. But I don’t think most of us appreciate how diverse and strange the era 10,000 - 3,000 years ago was. I think the number of incredibly beliefs and lenses on the world would boggle the mind.\nTo provide some evidence of this, I would like to proposed the following reading list (which I confess I haven’t read in its entirety myself):\n\nRichard Burtons Anatomy of Melancholy\nEdmund Spencers The Faerie Queane\nThomas Browns Urn Burial\nJohnathan Swifts ‘…’\n\n… (instead of this, go through these and find a list of strange ideas as examples) …\nThese works provide a fairly modern glimpse of the range of indescribably strange ideas that still existed in society in only the last 500 years. Now read this essay on Homer, and try to extrapolate back to the pre-Homeric period, where there were entire ethnicities devoted only to endlessly freestyling epic poetry. And try to imagine the number of things that people might have believed.\nThe thesis here is that the past is far, far stranger than we give it credit for– and similar to the tree of life, we are not experiencing a branching tree of culture evolving into new forms, but the paring back of a diverse range of impossible ideas into a smaller and smaller group of concrete cultures.\n\nOr maybe it isn’t so simple– that once eg. English has dominated every other language, it becomes large enough to sustain smaller languages within it. That the rhizome continues.\n\n\nThe Evolution of Language\nSimilarly, language is often seen as descending in a tree-like fashion from proto-indo-european. But I suggest that the early languages were as strange and diverse within themselves as the early anscestors of all life.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis was so clear to me that a friend once asked ‘What does Babylon meen to you?’ and in explaining I realised it means many different things– to some it is about hubris and ambitions to Godhead, and humility– to others, other things.↩︎\nThe end of the ‘brotherhood’ of ‘man’ in more outdated terms…↩︎"

    "text": "Not having ‘graduated highschool’ (not that that means anything, as I later would argue in Leipzig), I was left with limited choices for legitimizing myself in the eyes of society. This was, by this point, something I was increasingly interested in doing. Thankfully there were two universities in Scotland that had a ‘summer school for access’ programm– Aberdeen and Dundee. To Aberdeen I could commute etc., so I was packed off there.\nThe summer school was a wonderful farce, where all the oddballs of the world were sandwiched together into an improbably collective. It wasn’t just people who had left the system, like me, but also foreign students, older students, people wanting to change to radically different programms. A great collection of oddballs and we had a good time of it.\n\n\n\nI decided to study Maths with Chemistry, as I thought that sounded high-minded but yet practical. Unfortunately, having stopped engaging with education approximately a decade earlier, I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about in the introductory maths classes and soon dropped out. The only thing I went to in my first year was the chemistry labs, which were very fun– I had a great benchmate to crack jokes with, and would always fiddle my way through the protocol with a fair amount of flair and alacritty. I always finished an hour before everyone else, and not always because I cooked my books.\n\n\n\nThe few classes I went to in my second year (after switching majors) were dissapointing. The psychology class was just a room filled with 200 teenagers that did not give a fuck.\nI’m hardly one to ciriticize, but at this point I had decided I needed to start shaping up, so I was dissapointed. Probably they reflected my own tardiness and incompetence in the worst possible way.\n\n\n\n\nAfter two years in Aberdeen I had had enough, and had to hit the road. If I was better behaved I could of course have done erasmus, studied abroad, etc etc. But I was still a half-conscious idiot and couldn’t behave. I transferred to the Open University, the university for wild oddballs with no money or sense. They let me skip the first year on the meager credits I scraped together from Aberdeen, and the course was only three years total. Hurrah– something I could manage.\n\n\nThe course was physics. I think some part of me still saw the endeavour as something like ‘get the most prestigious degree you can with the least possible effort’, and Physics sounded suitable. I think I believed I could get through it unscathed. I was wrong.\nI cannot stress this enough: a serious study program will change you1.\nThe final year was a deeply religious experience. I foolishly started my studies a little late– remember it was all online. So I was a few months tardy in starting the most difficult courses of my Bachelors. I started working, and I did not stop working for many months. I feel like I was almost in a blackout the entire time, I was pushing myself so hard. I had taken a room in a squat for 80 euros a month. I had no heating or double glazing– there was ice on the inside of my windows for most of winter. I was forced into a reality that I readily accepted– like when one holds a pencil between ones teeth. It was obvious that I was a monk. And so I became one. I decided to do Lent in the high-romantic style borrowed from Thomas Aquinas– essentially I was vegan and could only eat when the sun was up. I would wake up every day at 6am and gorge myself on raw vegetables bought for next to nothing (or dumpster dived) from the verbrauchermarkt, go to the kitchen and boil a liter of water which I would add to a flask along with several spoonfulls of coffee and around 50mg of liquid amphetamines. I would then leave for the university, a long, beautiful winter walk through the parks in West Leipzig2. I would get to the university and, for the first few weeks, I would doze listlessly for several hours, my stomach groaning audibly from the effort of digesting a gross bolus of leeks or peppers or whatever bargain I was surviving off that week, drooling onto my palm or the desk. This was the punishment for my years of sleeping from 4am till noon. But it worked, and eventually my sleeping patterns came around.\nI was studying mostly on Khan Academy. I would eventually achieve 96% percent mastery on KA3. I averaged 3 hours a day of KA for that winter (including weekends and holidays!) And the rest of the day I spent on my textbooks. I had found with the earlier years that once I read the textbooks three times I had understood them quite well. (I got over 90%4 in my final exams for the penultimate year– I think that was a fair representation of my understanding of the course material.) However there was one module that was very calculous heavy that I never quite got to terms with completely– indeed, calculous remained a trying topic for the rest of my formal education. If I remember correctly I got something like 70% in that final exam.\nI would work in the library until 10 or 11 pm and then make my way home to sleep. I did very little that winter– though I did meet Emma, my first longterm partner, around then, and start taking the occasional stroll with her through the Schrebergartens.\nOn Saturday I would have a ritualized day of rest and relaxation. This consisted of\n\nthe 2 euro organ concert in the Nikolaikirch– this remains one of my most highly-rated Leipzig experiences, fantastic organist, stupendous organ, great interior– lovely church– I would without fail fall immediately into a deep and utterly peaceful slumber, my head resting against the huge columns– I used to say that that was the only place I really slept during those days– a thick dream of melody all about me–\nI would then go to TEDi (a 1-euro shop) and buy a packet of peanut flips for a euro, and eat it as I walked\nand I would finish up at the absinth bar, which was a strange and utterly-not-rateable (that is, too poor to rate) sort of haloween or goth-themed absinth bar which neverthless had an impressive selection, where I would get the house absinth on the rocks for 2 euros 40 cents\n\nAnd that was that. The only other thing to report from this time was the stress-induced fantasies of bodily mutilation that would plague me in the library, so much so that I started keeping a diary in which I reported them in graphic detail in order to exorcise them, with mixed success. May the Gods forget that unholy book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to speak to the head of studies at the Chemistry department to ask if I could do a Masters in Chemistry with them. He found this absurd and hilarious. Germans don’t think highly of us Brits and our felixibilty of mind it seems. Augen zu und durch5.\n\n\n\nI studied Physics in Leipzig for two years. It was, in many important ways, the most fullfilling time of my life. However, it was also incredibly draining– remember, I was competing with people who had come there directly from a decade of continuous mathematics education, in German universities. I was a degenerate wanderer who was kicked out of school at the age of 15. I had to push myself further than I ever imagined I would. I learned a great deal, about my limits and my capacities, and about physics.\nI focussed almost entirely on bio-related topics. Before the course began I investigated various departments, until I found one that had the dearly-sought line– we have student jobs available. I needed work desperately. I signed up for that class and a few others, and determined to woo the professor in short order.\nWhen my course started I was camping in an abandoned factory with an artist friend of mine. Every morning I would wake up, get dressed in a suit, hide my sleeping back in the floorboards of our building and walk to university. I had heard about LaTeX from somewhere, and figured it would work as a way of impressing my professor. The first homeworks were given out at the end of week two. That weekend I would spend one of only a few weekends I spent in the 24-hour library in the center– sweet charity for the dark Gods of academic intellect– so few because I was soon to have my own place of study. I did the homework, taught myself LaTex, and presented it beautifully over the course of 40-some hours. I handed it in on Monday, ink crisp. A few days later I recieved the praise I was waiting for– bide your time! Another homework at the end of that week, another beautiful LaTex document, and this time after it was marked and the compliments paid I asked the professor about the student jobs.\nI worked for him for two years. All the things I should say I will say– I learned so much more, not only contextualizing the classwork, but I was doing real research, they taught me how to code, I earned their trust, they gave me a great project. I was treated like a PhD student essentially. Much could be said about that job, only good things. Poverty was my fairy godmother. The Irish bar that turned me down after three (unpaid!) trial shifts only a few weeks before– they knew I was destined for greater things, they meant it charitably of course. No longer for that world was I! Now I think about it I might, now, in recent years, finally have spent more time behind the keyboard than the bar6.\nRegarding the studies– I had wanted to move back towards biochemistry for some time anyway, and I found biophysics suited me quite fine. I found (surprising no-one perhaps?) that I had a flair for public speaking7 and did my very best at the seminar classes. Two of the talks I gave for the Understanding Entropy seminar remain among my very proudest work. I intend to copy them on here sometime.\nThe research I was doing in my student job morphed into my masters thesis– I designed and built a custom microscope for molecular force spectroscopy, I had a budget of 40 thousand euros and very little oversight, it was heaven. I just played with lasers, listened to New Yorker literature podcasts and wrote software for 9 months in my own lab/office.\nTwo professors offered me PhD positions. I turned them down, and fled, ashamed, to the road. 5 days after my final defence I was in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI fled partly because I had terrible imposter syndrome and partly because I had run my brain ragged teaching it all of maths and physics in four years from a sitting, stoned, start. I was utterly terrified of the Thoeretical Physics professor who wanted to take me on, because I loved him, and I worried I would die trying to impress him. Also, more charitably to myself perhaps, I knew that I needed to learn to code, this much had become crystal clear from the research group I worked in, where the ratio of programming expertise to programming dependency left an enormous gaping hole that a scrupulous individual could cut an effective swathe through. And I had an enormous pile of research papers and books that had been piling up as I had run out of time to read.\nI stuffed a small backpack with pulped, pressed, printed wooden matter, one pair of socks, one item of underwear, a spare shirt, and set off.\nI will skip the travelogue and go straight to the study– aside from the many fasinating research papers that I read at the time, my main educational mission was to learn python. I bought a ticket out of Mumbai in short order to a city I had found on a list of cities sorted by cost of living (cheapest first) which noone had ever heard of, obviating the need for any will power to keep me out of the way of distraction. Mangalore8 it was called. I rented a room on the beach and started studying. My plan was to play with cellular automata. It was a great deal of fun, and served as a good enough fundament for my first applications.\n\n\n\nThe great benefit of working at startups is, you are expected to learn on the job, and they pay you little enough to encourage it. I learned a great deal of craft in startups. It is not the grand, mind-expanding knowledge of Physics, but it is valuable–nay, essential. I am, by now, a competent craftsman with code, with Linux, with Cloud Computing, with Databases, with system design etc etc. It has also changed me. And it has only been three years, shorter than a typical degree, and I had much more time for pleasure and travel in these years. And they do pay you! I find startup life quite fine, quite fine indeed.\nThe startup years are covered in the essay on work. So for now I will leave you here."

Accessibility is a measure of how easily and quickly people can reach different destinations within a city, and it is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of transportation systems and land use patterns. There are various ways to measure accessibility, but one common approach is to use a gravity model, which estimates the number of trips between different locations based on their distance, population size, and transportation infrastructure. Some researchers also include additional factors such as land use mix, walkability, and transit service quality in their accessibility measures. The effective density you described can be seen as a composite measure of accessibility considering both walking and public transportation.”"

This is a top-down view, focused on information flow (what do cells need to know in order to build or repair a structure? In what form and by what mechanism is the final morphology of any given organ or bodyplan encoded?) and distinct from the more popular bottom-up molecularly focused approach (what does protein X do?).”66 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n“If a tumor is induced on the limb of a salamander and the limb is amputated through the tumor, the remaining cancer tissue becomes part of the newly regenerating limb.”77 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n“While developmental biologists are some- what more inclined to try to explain and con- trol higher order (systems-level) properties such as intercellular coordinate systems (positional information) and organ size determination, regenerative medicine and cancer biology are currently focused on the cell-level mechanisms of proliferation control, metastasis and differentia- tion. High-impact advances require understand- ing of how organisms exert patterning control on a large scale and the synthesis of molecular genetic data into information-based models of morphogenesis.”88 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n“Two completely different structures are formed by cells that, until the cut occurred, were sharing all aspects of the local environment. Thus, still poorly understood long-range signals allow the wound cells to know where they are located, which direction the wound is facing and what other structures are still present in the fragment and do not need to be replaced.”99 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n“One interesting source and conduit for long-range patterning information is the CNS. Denervated amphibian limbs do not regenerate, while injury to specific parts of the brain or spinal cord results in abnormal patterning of regenerated appendages. The integrity of CNS connections near injured regions of planaria determines what structures are regenerated, and denervation of body regions causes disorganization of already existing structures and promotes tumorigenesis, suggesting a role for the nervous system in morphostasis and de novo morphogenesis. Important advances in regenerative control are likely to come from understanding the contribution of the brain and nervous system as instructive patterning cues, not only as permissive trophic signals.”1010 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n“Similarly, recent molecular work on the role of gap junctional communication in planarian regeneration revealed that a transiently induced change in the physiological (not genetic) state of cells can permanently reset the target morphology: two-headed planaria produced by a 48-h inhibition of gap junctional communication during regeneration will subsequently continue to regenerate as double-headed forms through multiple rounds of regeneration with no more exposure to gap junction blockers. Thus, the target morphology can be permanently changed, and is stored at least partially in the dynamic patterns of direct small molecule exchange among cells.

Bioelectrical activity is important for determination of fate and other key properties in a stem and progenitor cells [43–46], including adult human mesenchymal stem cell [47,48] and induced pluripotent stem cells [49]. More generally, low voltage gradients demarcate stem, cancer and embryonic cells, while hyperpolarized potentials belong to mature, highly differentiated somatic cells [50]. Using fluorescent voltage-reporter dyes and targeted misexpression of well-characterized ion transporters [51–53], the instructive signaling roles of transmembrane voltage gradients have been linked with downstream molecular genetic effector pathways such as redistribution of signaling molecules, integrin pathways, phosphatase cascades and chromatin modification [42,54].”[morphogenetic-fields]\n“These fundamental results highlight a tremendous and now realistic opportunity for the field to dissect the mechanisms of morphogenetic memory.”1212 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n“What physiological processes could encode pattern, and thus be capitalized upon for restorative therapies?

Incorporation of light-emitting elements into scaffolds and bioreactors will enable unprecedented levels of control over cell fate and growth rates for bioengineered constructs in vitro[68] and for regenerative sleeves used for organ regeneration in vivo[69].”1414 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n“True control over biological patterning will involve the development of computerized tools that enable algorithmic or generative models of patterning [78–81] (showing, at each step, how cells make the decisions that guide their behavior), and help biologists to infer stable candidate models from complex molecular and functional datasets.”1515 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n“Creation and maintenance of correct patterning of tissues and organs is the cornerstone of health; many biomedical interventions ultimately entail an attempt to restore the body’s ‘goal state’ with respect to shape. This means we must learn to understand the key aspects of the morphogenetic field that controls pattern formation, including its biochemical [82], bioelectrical [83,84], physical [78] and planar polarity [85] aspects, as well as develop technology to facilitate the organism’s use of this information during repair. Fortunately, theoretical tools and molecularly tractable model systems are now within reach.\nHeroic piecemeal interventions that address individual failing systems to extend the last years of a body are fundamentally a strategy of patching up a sinking ship. The cost of increasingly more complex interventions required for each success (increasing the number and age of individuals in need of the next patch) is a positive feedback loop that no society can afford in the long term. Regenerative medicine promises a break from this cycle, by activating programs for continuous organ repair that already exist within the host. By learning the most profound tricks of existing model species (which clearly show that perfect regeneration throughout the adult lifespan is possible for complex animals), we will ultimately revolutionize the concept of health and treatment of disease.”1616 The wisdom of the body: future techniques and approaches to morphogenetic fields in regenerative medicine, developmental biology and cancer\n\n“Breakthroughs in biomedicine and synthetic bioengineering require predictive, rational control over anatomical structure and function. Recent successes in manipulating cellular and molecular hardware have not been matched by progress in understanding the patterning software implemented during embryogenesis and regeneration. A fundamental capability gap is driving desired changes in growth and form to address birth defects and traumatic injury. Here we review new tools, results, and conceptual advances in an exciting emerging field: endogenous non-neural bioelectric signaling, which enables cellular collectives to make global decisions and implement large-scale pattern homeostasis. Spatially distributed electric circuits regulate gene expression, organ morphogenesis, and body-wide axial patterning. Developmental bioelectricity facilitates the interface to organ-level modular control points that direct patterning in vivo. Cracking the bioelectric code will enable transformative progress in bioengineering and regenerative medicine.”1717 The body electric 2.0: recent advances in developmental bioelectricity for regenerative and synthetic bioengineering\n\n\n\nImages\n\n\n\nBibliography"

In order to read somatic information, you need the muscle and nerve cells of the limbs etc.\nThe structure of the individual proteins encodes information about their location in the body. This happens during a process of activation, in which the local electrochemical signature is imprinted on the protein.\nTo extract the orguel, a solution of unactivated orguel proteins is injected into the body. These bind to the activated proteins in the cells, forming plaques. The plaques also record in their structure the location of the individual proteins in the cell. Thus the following information is stored: - in the structure of the plaque, the location of the proteins in the cell, and thus the history of the cell - in the elctochemical signature of the proteins, the cell type and species (used to locate the cell in the body)\nThe orguel is injected alongside a powerful enzyme which breaks down all the other proteins in the body. This is necessary to prevent the orguel from being broken down by the body’s own enzymes, and allows easy extraction of the plaques. The plaques then form longer ribbons which correspond closely to the position in the cell, simplifying the information readout.\nThe orguel\n\n\n\nReading\nLots of good notes here\nArtificial Life Some scientists suggest that the definition-of-life question is a red herring. Life, they say, should be gauged on a continuum, and not granted according to a binary decision. A rock would certainly be low on any continuum of aliveness, and a dog, a tree, and a human being would rank highly. More ambiguous systems would fall in a middleregion of semialiveness—somewhere below bacteria, which almost ev- eryone agrees are alive, and somewhere above rocks. Viruses, which some biologists consider living and others do not, would reside in the upper reaches of this middle ground. Below that would be complexsystems that no one really considers to be alive but that display some behaviors consistent with living organisms—things such as the economy and automobiles. The PolyWorld organisms would fall somewhere be- tween Chevrolets and the flu. There is a particular advantage in regard- ing life in this manner: using systems that no one would classify as truly alive, biologists could nonetheless isolate the qualities of life.\nNick Lane, Life Ascending\nAmerican Scientist\n\n\nVideos\nExtracting DNA from Strawberry DNA extraction with details about cell breakdown Extract from Banana with closeup Plaque formation, short and intense\nBEST: Tau proteins first in tubules, then forming plaques BEST: Plauqes and tangles\nMore good tao videos\nCool Reaction"

    "text": "Another route back to Eden, however leisurely and circuitous, is taken by the flaneur, who by losing himself aimlessly in the urban crowd can experience a fading of subjectivity, loosen his grip on the instrumental and see the city instead as a field of magical correspondences in the manner of the Surrealists. Language becomes revelation, not communication, and as such can yield us a glimpse of utopia. For those who stay at home rather than wander the boulevards, a similar effect can be obtained by a judicious dose of hashish.\n\nLots of good quotes here\nRemember to do a marginalia search! Its the perfect place for stuff like this.\n\nDeath and Life\nThe same report then deplores the stubborn tendency of chil dren to “fool around” instead of playing “recognized games.” (Recognized by whom?) This yearning for the Organization Child on the part of those who would incarcerate incidental play, and children’s stubborn preference for fooling around on city streets, teeming with life and adventure, are both as char acteristic today as they were in 1928.\nBut foresight is no longer required; only hindsight.\n\n\nMisc\nSeperate runs in terms of fractal dimension\nLots of good quotes in ‘The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman’:\n\nNow, what Dr Hoffman had done, in the first instance, was this. Consider the nature of a city. It is a vast repository of time, the discarded times of all the men and women who have lived, worked, dreamed and died in the streets which grow like a wilfully organic thing, unfurl like the petals of a mired rose and yet lack evanescence so entirely that they preserve the past in haphazard layers, so this alley is old while the avenue that runs beside it is newly built but nevertheless has been built over the deep-down, dead-in-the-ground relics of the older, perhaps the original, huddle of alleys which germinated the entire quarter. Dr Hoffman’s gigantic generators sent out a series of seismic vibrations which made great cracks in the hitherto immutable surface of the time and space equation we had informally formulated in order to realize our city and, out of these cracks, well – nobody knew what would come next. A kind of orgiastic panic seized the city. Those bluff, complaisant avenues and piazzas were suddenly as fertile in metamorphoses as a magic forest. Whether the apparitions were shades of the dead, synthetic reconstructions of the living or in no way replicas of anything we knew, they inhabited the same dimension as the living for Dr Hoffman had enormously extended the limits of this dimension. The very stones were mouths which spoke. I myself decided the revenants were objects – perhaps personified ideas – which could think but did not exist. This seemed the only hypothesis which might explain my own case for I acknowledged them – I saw them; they screamed and whickered at me – and yet I did not believe in them. This phantasmagoric redefinition of a city was constantly fluctuating for it was now the kingdom of the instantaneous. Cloud palaces erected themselves then silently toppled to reveal for a moment the familiar warehouse beneath them until they were replaced by some fresh audacity. A group of chanting pillars exploded in the middle of a mantra and lo! they were once again street lamps until, with night, they changed to silent flowers. Giant heads in the helmets of conquistadors sailed up like sad, painted kites over the giggling chimney pots. Hardly anything remained the same for more than one second and the city was no longer the conscious production of humanity; it had become the arbitrary realm of dream.\n\nI’ll just quote that last part again: > Hardly anything remained the same for more than one second and the city was no longer the conscious production of humanity; it had become the arbitrary realm of dream.\n\nPast time occupied the city for whole days together, sometimes, so that the streets of a hundred years before were superimposed on nowadays streets and I made my way to the Bureau only by memory, along never-before-trodden lanes that looked as indestructible as earth itself"

It’s actually quite different from what I expected. I mean I know I listen to a lot of solo piano music, but that is a little absurd. And how did John Cale get in there as second!\nThe more I look at that list the more perplexing I find it. I guess I did download a lot of music this year and listen to it on my laptop, so the numbers are quite a bit skewed by that. But that still means that I have listened to 16h or the Polyrythmic Orchestra of Cotonou!\nThe only thing I find totally unrealistic is the 12h of Brahms and the 8h of Beethoven– they must both be from the Menuhin Century album– the ‘Virtuoso and Landmark Recordings’ CDs are full of Brahms and Beethoven, and I listen to it regularly. But in my defense I’m mostly in it for the Menuhin– those two plus the Shostakovich– and maybe even the Rachmaninoff?

A lot of the hours that Liszt has racked up are due to the album ‘Harmonies poétiques et religieuses’, which, I have to admit, has failed to really hit home with me. I spent many hours with the album, as you can see, because I have had good luck with other long Liszt suites (such as the Annees), just by listening to them again and again until they start to sink in. But the Harmonies still haven’t settled in, in fact I hardly remember them, which is why I was so surprised that Liszt was so high on the numbers for the last year.\nLo-Pacific by the Sun City Girls is great, but is an entire album as a single track so is cheating a little bit.\nWhat is Kansas by Opinion? I have never heard of that. Apparently it is on a playlist I created though, so apparently I listened to it and liked it once upon a time– or rather, 4 times upon a time, since it is 30 mins long. I’ll drop it too.\nIf I remove the classical stuff and Lo-Pacific, then the top tracks looks like this:\n\nTop Tracks (All)Top Tracks (Non-Classical)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf = sort_df_by_track(listening_df)\n\n# Show columns in the order 'Track', 'Artist', 'Time'\ndf = df[['Track', 'Artist', 'Time']]\ndf.head(30).style.hide_index()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Track\n      Artist\n      Time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \"J\" Blues 72\n      Shin Joong Hyun\n      3h:36m\n    \n    \n      Harmonies poétiques et religieuses, S. 173: III.

The deaths per capita don’t diminish to insignificance when graphed per capita.\n\n\nConclusion\nLooks like stampede deaths are staying roughly steady. I guess I have to conclude that my initial assumption that the safety society is stopping people from having fun can’t be supported! Maybe the increased density of cities really does require lots of increased safety measures, so as cities become more populated they don’t become more dangerous.\nOf course there would likely be significant underreporting in the historical data, but to be honest I was expecting the results to show a decrease in deaths without accounting for that. I suppose I will have to eat my hat!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Quotes\nAbstract: Synthetic biology and bioengineering provide the opportunity to create novel embodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of chimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software. These advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences, whose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model species. In this Perspective, I introduce TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a nonbinary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. TAME provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates. When applied to regenerating/developmental systems, TAME suggests a perspective on morphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep symmetry between problem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D (traditional behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive capacities can increase during evolution. An important medium exploited by evolution for joining active subunits into greater agents is developmental bioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap junctions to scale up cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This architecture of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important implications for plasticity of bodies and minds, greatly potentiating evolvability. Considering classical and recent data from the perspectives of computational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals a rich research program with many implications for cognitive science, evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence.\n\n“In this Perspective, I introduce TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a nonbinary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. TAME provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates.”\n\n\n“All known cognitive agents are collective intelligences, because we are all made of parts; biological agents in particular are not just structurally modular, but made of parts that are themselves agents in important ways. There is no truly monadic, indivisible yet cognitive being: all known minds reside in physical systems composed of components of various complexity and active behavior.”\n\n\n“The framework, TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—adopts a practical, constructive engineering perspective on the optimal place for a given system on the continuum of cognitive sophistication. This gives rise to an axis of persuadability (Figure 2), which is closely related to the Intentional Stance (Dennett, 1987) but made more explicit in terms of functional engineering approaches needed to implement prediction and control in practice. Persuadability refers to the type of conceptual and practical tools that are optimal to rationally modify a given system’s behavior. The origin story (designed vs. evolved), composition, and other aspects are not definitive guides to the correct level of agency for a living or non-living system. Instead, one must perform experiments to see which kind of intervention strategy provides the most efficient prediction and control (thus, one aim should be generalizing the human-focused Turing Test and other IQ metrics into a broader agency detection toolkit, which perhaps could itself be implemented by a useful algorithm).”\n\n\n“These hypotheses suggest a specific way to understand the scaling of cognitive capacity through evolution, make interesting predictions, and suggest novel experimental work. They also provide ways to think about the impending expansion of the “space of possible bodies and minds” via the efforts of bioengineers, which is sure to disrupt categories and conclusions that have been formed in the context of today’s natural biosphere.”\n\n\n“Selves exist across a continuum of persuadability, and it is an empirical question as to where on this axis any given system lies (revealed by the ratio of prediction and control vs. effort and knowledge that needs to be input, for any given way of relating to that system).\n\nSelves are not fixed, permanent agents—their substrate can remodel radically during their lifetime; the owner of memories and preferences, and the subject that interprets rewards and punishments, is malleable and plastic.\nThe core of being a Self is the ability to pursue goals. Selves can be nested and overlapping, cooperating and competing both laterally and across levels. Each higher-level self deforms the option space for the lower level Selves, enabling them to follow energy minimization to achieve outcomes that look inevitable and simple at one scale, while serving intelligent goals at a higher scale.”\n\n“A proposed way to visualize a continuum of agency, which frames the problem in a way that is testable and drives empirical progress, is via an “axis of persuadability”: to what level of control (ranging from brute force micromanagement to persuasion by rational argument) is any given system amenable, given the sophistication of its cognitive apparatus?”\n\n\n“The main goal is to help advance and delineate an exciting emerging field at the intersection of biology, philosophy, and the information sciences. By proposing a new framework and examining it in a broad context of now physically realizable (not merely logically possible) living structures, it may be possible to bring conceptual, philosophical thought up to date with recent advances in science and technology. At stake are current knowledge gaps in evolutionary, developmental, and cell biology, a new roadmap for regenerative medicine, lessons that could be ported to artificial intelligence and robotics, and broader implications for ethics.”\n\n\n“This is crucial to understanding agency and intelligence at multiple scales and in unfamiliar embodiments because observations like this begin to break down the notion of Selves as monadic, immutable objects with a privileged scale. Becoming comfortable with biological cognitive agents that are malleable in terms of form and function (change radically during the lifetime of an individual) makes it easier to understand the origins and changes of cognition during evolution or as the result of bioengineering effort.”\n\n\n“Even when housed in the same “body,” memories must move between tissues—for example, in a trained planarian’s tail fragment re-imprinting its learned information onto the newly regenerated brain, or the movement of memories onto new brain tissue during metamorphosis. In addition to the spatial movement and re-mapping of memories onto new substrates, there is also a temporal component, as each memory is really an instance of communication between past and future Selves. The plasticity of biological bodies, made of cells that die, are born, and significantly rearrange their tissue architecture, suggests that the understanding of cognition is fundamentally a problem of collective intelligence: to understand how stable cognitive structures can persist and map onto swarm dynamics, with preferences and stressors that scale from those of their components.”\n\n\n“First, the gulf between planarian regeneration/insect metamorphosis and human brains is going to be bridged by emerging therapeutics. It is inevitable that stem cell therapies for degenerative brain diseases (Forraz et al., 2013; Rosser and Svendsen, 2014; Tanna and Sachan, 2014) will confront us with humans whose brains are partially replaced by the naïve progeny of cells that were not present during the formation of memories and personality traits in the patient. Even prior to these advances, it was clear that phenomena such as dissociative identity disorder (Miller and Triggiano, 1992), communication with non-verbal brain hemispheres in commissurotomy patients (Nagel, 1971; Montgomery, 2003), conjoined twins with fused brains (Gazzaniga, 1970; Barilan, 2003), etc., place human cognition onto a continuous spectrum with respect to the plasticity of integrated Selves that reside within a particular biological tissue implementation.”\n\n\n“For example, it is now easy to radically modify bodies in a time-scale that is much faster than evolutionary change, to study the inherent plasticity of minds without eons of selection to shape them to fit specific body architectures. When tadpoles are created to have eyes on their tails, instead of their heads, they are still readily able to perform visual learning tasks. Planaria can readily be made with two (or more) brains in the same body, and human patients are now routinely augmented with novel inputs such as sensory substitution or novel effectors, such as instrumentized interfaces allowing thought to control engineered devices such as wheelchairs in addition to the default muscle-driven peripherals of their own bodies. The central phenomenon here is plasticity: minds are not tightly bound to one specific underlying architecture (as most of our software is today), but readily mold to changes of genomic defaults. The logical extension of this progress is a focus on self-modifying living beings and the creation of new agents in which the mind:body system is simplified by entirely replacing one side of the equation with an engineered construct. The benefit would be that at least one half of the system is now well-understood.”\n\n\n“Biobots, hybrots, cyborgs, synthetic and chimeric animals, genetically and cellularly bioengineered living forms, humans instrumentized to knowledge platforms, devices, and each other—these technologies are going to generate beings whose body architectures are nothing like our familiar phylogeny. They will be a functional mix of evolved and designed components; at all levels, smart materials, software-level systems, and living tissue will be integrated into novel beings which function in their own exotic Umwelt.”\n\n\n\nAcronyms\n\nTAME: Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere\n\n\n\nBibliography"

The reason for suggesting this is that humans have many interests, and being pain-free is just one of them. … Tinker Bell’s emotions completely consume her because she is so small that she has no room for complex emotion.”\n\nMoral Weights of Six Animals\n\n\n\nThis provides one extreme of a helpful continuum of feeling versus verbalization, approximately: Bambi can feel, but cannot verbalize; humans can verbalize and feel; Bing can verbalize but cannot feel.\nI found this a useful intuition pump for thinking about the difference between embodied beings such as you and I, and disembodied systems such as Bing, and the relative ethical weight to give them. So much of what we call suffering is physiological, and even when the cause is purely intellectual (eg. in love)– the body is the vehicle through which it manifests, in the gut, in migraine, tension, Parkinsonism etc. Without access to this, it is hard to imagine LLMs as suffering in any similar way to humans or animals.\nNot that I think it is good or wise to laugh at Bing, any more than it is good or wise to cage and torment an animal or human."

    "text": "Computer Programmer (Python Developer)\nThe title of this section is a joke, due to this unfortunate interaction\n[whatsapp-python-developer][image]\nwhich lead to one of the most thoroughgoing dressing-downs I have ever recieved from someone ten years my junior. It was in one of my wilder summers1 when I was frequenting the afterparies of Impulstanz Festival in Vienna. The individual with whom I had been texting told me with an intense and terrifying mix of fondness and fury that that was not a good response to a question about what one does– not a good way of continuing a conversation. To give you a flavour of her assaults, near the end of the evening she was getting into a taxi mid-rant and pointed at a friend who knew the address of the next location and then at us saying ‘these motherfuckers are coming to the afterparty’ without a trace of delicacy. Presumably we were coming there for a grilling.\nIn any case, I do indeed program computers. And while I nominally do so using python, I am also increasingly comfortable with bash, with markdown, with SQL[^Postgres– see my tips folder.], and with those weird pseudo-DSLs that are basically glorified config files– I’m basically talking about YAML of course– that constitute much of the ‘DevOps’ lifecycle. I also, though I am not proud of this, occasionally click my way through a maze of AWS screens, though I prefer to do that sort of thing in terraform when I can (or bash).\n\nONDEWO\nOnce I got home from India, I was working on my parents farm, utterly destitute again, not a penny to my name. I applied for many jobs, and I got an interview for one. The programming task seemed quite challenging. With hindsight, it was totally unreasonable– my boss later told me that he had since tried useding it on other people and noone else ever managed to submit anything. I was given a week to finish it, and I worked on it 20-some hours a day (by the end ceasing to sleep entirely) until I had cracked it sufficiently well to submit it.\nI got the job and moved to Austria. My first month was quite intense, it was clear I was underqualified so I worked myself to the bone, while also needing to spend much of my evenings entertaining couch surfing hosts and shmoozing at art fairs in order to find a home– I didn’t have enough money to pay rent until I got my first paycheck. One of my coworkers took me in for a week, and I found a flat through a friend, where I didn’t have to pay till the next month.\n\nHistory\nWow, what a place! This was my first job as an actual software engineer, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity, the experience, and for setting a low bar for all my future bosses to rise above!\nI need to address that first. The boss at ONDEWO was quite the man. He was credentialled, hard-working, and determined. He was also really quite talented at finding talent! The team, when I arrived, was quite cool, lots of very intelligent people doing interesting work. And he chose a solid problem to work on. I really believe it could have all worked out actually, and he could have had his dream of being an Austrian Unicorn. Alas! It was not to be! Sometimes my heart bleeds a little for him.\nBut for the little, really quite tiny, microscopic even, cracks in the edifice. It was not all right. In fact it was quite wrong, and the subtle ways in which if failed to obtain, again and again, showed through– the cracks widened– the edifice crubled. All that really happened was, he was not straightforward. All that happened was, he treated his employees to the smae bullshit that he treated prospective customers. He was fundamentally, achingly dishonest, hard to trust or to like, and his manipulations were too obvious (and therefore odious). I think if he had been more direct and open with his employees, if he had managed to ‘turn off’ his modus operandi every now and then and communicate with us individually, with anyone, it could have worked. But I don’t think anyone got through to him.\nThe classic story happened. One of his highest-up quit, and over the next two years so did everyone else. It was very obvious what was happening, as it was happening. The entire drama played out with that deeply moving sense of historical inevitability– you felt like you were watching one of the great dramas, a tragicomedy.\nThere isn’t much more to say on the timelines. I worked incrdibly hard, I don’t know how much if I include all the evenings reading blogs and tutorials on the internet. Fully 50 hours a week in the office, but and extra 10-30 a week of reading I suspect. There was a time when I was also coding on the weekends, but I started getting muscle cramps in my forearms, and thankfully noticed and stopped in time. In fact I spent some weeks trying not to use my arms at all when I was not at work, there were strange motions under the surface, my muscles were not happy, and I am very thankful that I am blessed with enough proprioception to notice this soon enough to manage it.\n\n\nTech\nI was a python developer. But my first task was quite out there. I had to wrestle with a huge, old python2 library, and try to turn it into something useable.\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\nHypermile\nI am currently working in a tech startup that is working in the vehicle automation space. We would probably like to one day make self-driving trucks– but in the meantime2 we are working on AI-powered advanced cruise control for making truckers lives more comfortable and more energy efficient– and more interestingly (and more immediately for myself personally) providing a large amount of data for use to learn from, train on, and generally play with."

    "text": "Alacritty is one of the many lovely developer tools that are springing up as the first flush in the Rust revolution. Its a fantastic terminal that I’m sure I will have more to say about in due time.\nAs noted, I discovered something lovely while transferring some files the other day. I was moving my small film collection (currently stretching to 7 titles: <INSERT FILMS>) from one computer to another, and I just wanted to sanity check that the transfer had succeeded. So I sshed into the machine ssh work and ran vlc -I dummy ~/films/Mullholland\\ Dr.mkv.\nImagine my surprise to see the criterion logo appear, animated before me. Here is a nice still from another film to illustrate: \nYou can also look at a copy-paste of the terminal here to prove that it really is ASCII output.\n\nZooming out, the resolution becomes better and better (text), but it starts to jitter quite badly at a certain size. \nI thought the ssh connection might be a bottleneck, so I went to the computer to try it on one machine. I had that slightly haunted feeling that the magic might disappear, and when I entered the terminal I suddenly wondered >How will I get it to work here? If I run vlc -I dummy ~/filmes/Crash.mkv I’ll just get a window.\nbut as soon as the thought was there I realised I could just start with ssh localhost. And it worked. I was watching the ‘Universal’ logo barge into my terminal.\nBut things got even better. I noticed that my keystrokes were even getting sent back to vlc, so I could skip forward, pause and even quit the film (sometimes it gets stuck and I have to killall vlc but so it goes).\nAfter a little sleuthing, I notice that\nvlc -I dummy ~/films/film.choice\nis interactive, but\nvlc ~/films/film.choice\nis not. What is this dummy terminal doing after all? Well, the vlc wiki has a little info[^vlc dummy], and they nicely point out that keystrokes are sent back. I find the terminology a little odd, since ‘dummy video output’ is just normal video output, but I think they are looking at it from a gui-makers perspective. And this seems to be the key– with the dummy interface, vlc streams the movie to a window. Alacritty is presumably pretending to be a screen or a window of some sort, in order to pass its work to the GPU, so VLC merrily dumps the video stream in there.\nWhat I would love to know, and I might take some time to investigate, is how is Alacritty mapping the video stream to ASCII? And why?\n\nI will leave this story here for now. I have two things in mind: one, to investigate further over at the Alacritty github and two, to have some people round for a film, run it through Alacritty-ASCII and run the audio through a digital soundcard or some synths, and make a little performance. I’ll update if either of these things transpire.\nIn the meantime, if you want to try it yourself, I have uploaded a slightly rushed video of the effect in action (the size limit on asciinema was not made with 4k ASCII movies in mind, so no hard feelings). Asciinema cast attached1.\nAnd here is a final zoomed in still to admire. In the attached text you can see how much of a difference the color makes, presumably a lot of the 8s have the same foreground and background color.\n\n\n\n\n\nmuscle kid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nhttps://asciinema.org/a/378193 [^vlc dummy]: https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/dummy/↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m going to mirror my blog in Hyperspace (aka the backend of the Beaker browser, if you don’t know about it I suggest you check that out first).\nTo do this, I’m going to try setting up my free micro instance1 in the gcloud as a hyperdrive host.\n\nHyperdrive Host\nI’ve had trouble doing big installs on a micro instance before. For reference, here are the specs of a micro instance:\n\n\n\nRAM\nCores\nMem\n\n\n\n\n0.6GB\n0.2 (aka a shared core!)\n32GB\n\n\n\nI run my ansible script against it, and it dies. I try to install and run a docker image, it dies. It is not made for grand works. Or even minor works.\nSo in order to get everything nicely installed and prepared I decided to make a ‘standard simple computer’. This is a decently-proportioned machine I can run in the cloud for generating snapshots that can be used as the base image for smaller, gentler machines. It does all the installations without crashing.\nI also used the opportunity to try out a preemptible instance. This is an instance that google can kill whenever, and is about 3x cheaper than a normal machine. Since I am just running this machine to do little tasks in the cloud, I don’t care if it gets killed sometimes. However, I didn’t realise that my free cloud credits can’t be used for preemptible instances, I only found this out after. This means– shock horror! I will actually get billed for this usage. Lets see how much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSKU\nService\nUsage\nCost\n\n\n\n\nPreemptible E2 Instance Core running in Americas\nCompute Engine\n1.63 hour\n€0.01\n\n\nPreemptible E2 Instance Ram running in Americas\nCompute Engine\n6.5 gibibyte hour\n€0.00\n\n\n\nOkay not too terrible.\nSo now I have a snapshot with some basic things installed, I can try running a hyperdrive host. Obviously I don’t need all my command-line tools and everything to really run it, but its nice to have this snapshot available for future machines. And when I get it all running stably, I can create a minimal snapshot with only the server I want so it runs more smoothly.\nTo make my hyperdrive, I’m just going to open up the Beaker browser and see how it is these days, it’s been almost six months since I used it and it’s developing rapidly. Oh! They have a ‘create hyperdrive from git repo’ button now! This gets better and better.\nSo I’m now hosted on the Beaker network. URL.\nOkay so it seems the way Hugo generates sites, based on the CNAME that I supplied, means that all the links from the frontpage on beaker go straight to the clearnet version at www.fergusfettes.com. This is slightly annoying but I’ll not work on it now, since all the rest of the stuff is actually there, it just isn’t linked correctly. This post on the hyperspace, for example.\nAnother thing to note, is I would need to host all the images in hyperspace too to be really complete. However, as it is now, it is a great demonstration of how nicely the hyper protocol interacts with http.\nSo now I’m restarting my micro instance with the hyperdrive installed. Starting hyperspace (hyperspace start), and hyperdrive (hyperdrive start). Playing around with the hyperdrive cli, I can get info about my local hyperdrvie once I have cd’ed into it: cd Hyperdrive; hyperdrive info --root.\nNow I’ll try mounting the hyperdrive that was created on my laptop by the Beaker browser. I copy the URL ID (aka. without the ‘hyper://’) and serve it with\nhyperdrive mount cb8bb0fdb843f78267df2dce7c4dd3cb4fd89a9b16c4454912691a73e5d1c737\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/cb8bb0fdb843f78267df2dce7c4dd3cb4fd89a9b16c4454912691a73e5d1c737\n(after the mount there is handy output telling you what to do next :D).\nHaving a look around the beaker user list, I found my first attempt at a beaker blog is still being hosted (I’m @frgnym)! I feel so touched! Someone out there is still on my website! I’ll seed it too:\nhyperdrive mount c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nOkay awesome. I’m not only newly mirrored on the hyper network, my old website is still on there. So great. That was incredibly easy. Maybe I’ll start using the beaker browser as my primary browser. (I always say that.)\nSo now my old website is hosted in three places, whoever was hosting it before, my micro instance, and the browser I am currently viewing it from. See the little three in the top right: \nAnd now this blog is hosted there too! Excellent. Now lets see how the IPFS fares!\nUPDATE: It was obviously Kicks Condor who was hosting it before, so I’m hosting their drive now too.\nUPDATE2: So, the micro host wasn’t actually working. I ran a couple tests, turns out I used the complete wrong command. I should have used the following:\nhyperdrive mount some_random_name c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/some_random_name\nThe random name doesn’t seen to affect the seeded drive. ‘hyperdrive mount X’ creates a new drive called x and creates a new key for it, so I had folders named after all my old drives with new keys and no content.\nAnyway I fixed all the mounts and now I see the IP of my micro host in the top right under the hosts. In other news, this means that there were three people hosting my old blog before, and now there are 4!\n\n\nIPFS Host\nOkay so I’ve started my small computer again and I’m going through the Command-line quickstart. Seems pretty straightforward.\nSo I dumped the contents of my dotfiles into my local IPFS node (ipfs add -r ~/dotfiles), and now I’m going to serve it and mount it. I ran the daemon (ipfs daemon) and set up an ssh tunnel to my small computer ssh -fNL 5001:localhost:5001 small-computer so I can see the IPFS dashboard at localhost:5001. Very snazzy! I can see the files I added too.\nNow I’ll get the browser plugin that lets me view IPFS files in Firefox. Actually since the install was so easy, I’ll run an IPFS node on my local laptop too. When I add my dotfiles locally, I notice that they have the same hashes as when I added them on the server. This is key to the coolest feature of the IPFS– since these files had already been added by me elsewhere, they didn’t get added again, and when I tried to add them locally the network determined this and just ‘pinned’ them as well, aka my local node automatically became a seeder of these same files. Network deduplication. This is a game-changer. Particularly in a world where things like the pypi and npm exist, where vast numbers of developer-hours are spent redoing work, it is easy to see how the notion of deduplication can be expanded to do more and more abstract kinds of energy-saving work. (Imagine writing tests for kinds of work you want code to do, and the code itself being mutable. If multiple people had done work that passed those tests, you could choose between them based on other factors like speed, efficiency etc.)\nSo anyway. Now I go to my blog, and do ipfs add -r public2, and hey presto, my blog is in the IPFS. Running on my local machine, that link redirects to the following:\nhttp://bafybeibgegkyol2e5txemzjuflbpjrsh6da2xxbyzzilahtilsp3jxxaa4.ipfs.localhost:8080/\nso it just gets the file from the local folder nice and easy. However, when I go to the same link in Chrome (where I havent installed the plugin) it loads as well without a redirect (after some time). So I think the ipfs.io acts as a temporary node, grabbing the hash you request from the network and serving it over http. Aka, it came to my local node, got the file, then gave it back to me.\nNow, the blog in the IPFS has the same issue as the one in hyperspace– all the links point to the clearnet. However this is still fine for now, and still shows nicely how the two protocols interact.\nSo now I just need to set up the host in my micro instance, and I’m done for the day. I’m going to take a risk and try to do it directly in my micro host. It’ll probably crash and die but lets see.\nI shut down some unnecessary services on the host. I’ve inited the ipfs node. And added the blog again. And started the daemon. And the node is still accessible. I shut down my local node and tried the URL again through the ipfs gateway and.. its there! I’m a little worried it’s just being cached by the ipfs gateway but I’ll check back tomorrow and see.\nNice! I’m now mirrored on two decentralized internet protocols! I’m safe in the case of nuclear apocalypse! I’m part of the future!\n\n\nConculsions\nVery cool to have finally actually used both of these protocols, I have been following and stanning them for ages now. They both exceed expectations in terms of user-friendliness and just-works-ness. Maybe thats just because I’m a programmer now so things are easier, but their install and setup instructions are really nice and clear and worked without a hitch in this case.\nObviously there are still some things I need to sort out, and some things I want to try: 1. Set up cronjobs to update all three of the hosts once per day with the latest content (I know I should use build pipelines but I have never used github pipelines and I think a little cronjob is fine for now). 2. See if it is possible to have relative paths that work in all three hosts, so internal links work properly and always link within the same protocol. 3. Have a look at hyper-ipfs inter-operability. 4. Set up nodes on a raspberry pi and serve from home.\nIn terms of updating, becaue I just dumped whatever blog I had at the time into the protocol, the version in hyper doesn’t have this post at all, and the version in IPFS has this post without the IPFS content. This needs to be fixed first. The other things will take more time and tweaking so I’ll put them on the back burner for now.\nSo! Great success! I’m off to a New Years bonfire now. Lets burn the bad 2020-vibes away.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWith the Google Cloud Platform free developer package, you get a teeny little machine in the cloud for free forever.↩︎\nI made a point of checking if hidden files are added, they aren’t by default so the .git folder should be skipped.↩︎"

    "text": "Getting Started\nFirst I went over my old JS experinements/work, refactoring a little and refamiliarising myself with the concepts. I ran some of my old 3D geometry monstrosities, and signed up as an oculus developer.\nThe first hurdle I hit was serving my creations to the headset. WebXR only works over https. But there are built-in execptions for localhost, so I had to get the Oculus to think it was at my localhost– sounds like a job for port forwarding.\nI started with the oculus chrome debugging guide. I find myself using something called ‘adb’– I assume this is the android debugger. This is exciting! I’m now an adroid developer apparently.\n$ adb devices\nList of devices attached\n1WMHH83CNH0522  device\nI found the IP of the machine and tried to ssh in:\n$ adb shell ip route\n192.168.1.0/24 dev wlan0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.185\n$ ssh -fNR 1234:localhost:1234 192.168.1.185\nbut to no avail. A moment or two googling later I found the command:\n$ adb reverse tcp:1234 tcp:1234\nand we’re away! I can now open locally hosted sites on my Oculus! And I imagine I have also learned some stuff that will be useful for using my phone as a webcam or other such tricks, very excellent."

This is fortunate because I gives me something to do! It only uses two triggers for everything– you can paint, and resize your tool. I will add some buttons. To learn the correct names for the events, I’m copying this example from the lovely list of WebXR Samples. In fact I’ve cloned the whole repo so I can read through it."

So I’m going back to the debug guide to actually catch the events as they are happening.\nSo now I have chrome on my laptop debugging the session in the Oculus. Snazzy.\nI try the Event Listener Breakpoints but no dice. Maybe its too new of a feature? Anyway I stick a breakpoint in the render loop and try to trigger it– my headset only functions when you are wearing it, so I have to have one eye in the headset and one the debugger, but eventually I manager to capture an event. I’ll eventually try to find a way to leave the headset running when I’m not wearing it.\ncontroller1.addEventListener('selectstart', () => {console.log('hello')})\nFrom that captured event I get a nice log dump of all the features–\n...\ngamepad: Gamepad {id: \"\", index: -1, connected: true, timestamp: 734840.0999999994, mapping: \"xr-standard\", …}\ngripSpace: XRSpace {}\nhandedness: \"right\"\nprofiles: (4) [\"oculus-touch-v3\", \"oculus-touch-v2\", \"oculus-touch\", \"generic-trigger-squeeze-thumbstick\"]\ntargetRayMode: \"tracked-pointer\"\n...\nSo that is something to work with!"

    "text": "Progress\nBefore tryig to integrate any of the fancy stuff from the WebXR example page (fancy just meaning ‘basic graphics’, but they write all the vertices themselves so it looks a lot more than some simple ThreeJS stuff), I decided to make a quick sanity check so I can really set stuff up to work nicely. So here I am just dumping all the events from the gamepads into the console:\nfunction render() {\n  session = renderer.xr.getSession();\n\n  if (session) {\n    for (let source of session.inputSources) {\n      if (source.gamepad) {\n        ProcessGamepad(source.gamepad, source.handedness);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  handleController( controller1 );\n  handleController( controller2 );\n\n  renderer.render( scene, camera );\n}\n\n\nfunction ProcessGamepad(gamepad, hand, pose) {\n  console.log(hand)\n  update_state(gamepad)\n};\n\nfunction update_state (gamepad) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < gamepad.buttons.length; ++i) {\n    if (gamepad.buttons[i].pressed){\n      console.log('button pressed: ' + i + ', value: ' + gamepad.buttons[i].value + ', touched: ' + gamepad.buttons[i].touched)\n    }\n  }\n  for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < gamepad.axes.length; i+=2, ++j) {\n    console.log(gamepad.axes[i], i + 1 < gamepad.axes.length ? gamepad.axes[i + 1] : 0);\n  }\n}\nI start it up and it works! My Oculus controller has buttons 0, 1, 4 and 5, and 3 is the joystick click. I assume 2 is reseved for the oculus button on the right controller, though maybe I can use it on the left one. It also has sensitive axes on buttons 0 and 1, and the joystick. Plus position information! A veritable wealth of possibilities.\nI’ll continue with this tomorrow."

I got very confused by it because I couldn’t believe that they hadn’t added the functionality to change the color, but I guess the project is really a stub.\nIn fact the more I look into VR development the puzzles I am spotting. I looks like there was a major boom in VR about five years ago, most of the libraries I’m working with were started back then. But then they seem to have somewhat petered out. Maybe we are currently in a little VR-winter, as the initial hype overshot all reality. Maybe we are heading into a thaw now. Lets see.\nFurthermore, notes after a day or two of regular Oculus useage– it definitely takes a toll on the eyes. Everything has a somewhat hallucinagenic quality when you come out of it, like an acid comedown. I’m not sure if this effect will diminish or grow with continued usage. I can see it being very problematic for people who suffer from HPPD.\nOr maybe all the Oculus Developers are elsewhere, working with the Unreal Engine or Unity or someeuch. Maybe ThreeJS isn’t cool. But I must say I am impressed by how much this thing can run, I spend 20 minutes filling my vision with layer upon layer of multicoloured swirls, without noticing any drop in quality or responsivness.\nThe next part I have to integrate is the VR answer to the dat-gui library. Also made 4 years ago."

In the process I stumled across some other stuff that might come in useful. At the end of the day what I need is this: * Vim Javascript Implimentation for my editor * RiftSketch for the framework * ThreeJS Editor tools stolen from here. Actually maybe I can just skip RiftSketch and add Vim and a VRButton directly to that. But I would feel bad if I left RiftSketch behind.\nAll of this mixed with my paint program of course! It’s going to be mental.\nIn all seriousness, in the short term, if I can integrate that JS Vim implementation into RiftSketch I will be a happy man.\nThis process is teaching me a great deal about JavaScript. That should go without saying. In the last hour I learned: * how to use prettier and eslint to lint my stuff * how to reverse engineer files from .maps * more about building/packaing etc (still trying to use parcel for everything since it is nice and minimal)"

    "text": "Introduction\nCartography is an ancient and noble art. It has continued apace into the modern era. It seems clear that it will be a useful tool in my kit, both regarding my career as well as my hobbies, and there are many fun everyday applications of it, so I am finally diving in to studying it in a little more detail.\nMain\n\n\nPsychoGeography: Nov 2, 2022\nThis was my third attempt at making a psychogeography tool for drawing nice routes on the city.\nIn the first two attempts I was focusing on the mapping side, seing if I could generate the routes from text. This time I decided to try it freestyle in order to gather data about eg. how long it takes to trace the path of a word, how good the result looks on the map, how much doubling back you have to do etc.\n\n\nThere was 1 run today.\n\n\nPsychoGeography 1 started at 19:57 and finished at 20:40 (42.7 minutes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like it was moderately successful. I think the key to getting really good results will be to write some code that looks all over the city for districts that have shapes that match what you want to draw.\nIn terms of the psychogeography of it, I turned off my podcast as I got to the top of the first letter, and tried to focus on being in the city as I toured the letters. I tried to keep an awareness both of the letter I was forming, and how it sat in between the buildings, and of the district I was travelling through, and its characteristic features1.1 I will update this with a link to a page with more psychogeography reading once I have collected more material.\nI think with practice it should be possible to clean up the letters a bit by thinking more of the calligraphy as you are drawing– though this would mean more time spent on roads etc; would probably be easier to get better shapes at night when you don’t have to stick to the pavements so much."

    "text": "Themes\n\nDomestic Violence and Gender\nThe Fassbinder interpretation focuses almost entirely on Franz et sein filles. One wonders at times if it is really necessary to have 9 hours of women treating him like a prince to exacerbate the awfulness of the violence– but this seems a lot of what is going on.\nFassbinders feminine eye makes it strangely pallatable, as he manages to make his female characters cahracterful and agentic, despite their role as foils for the relationship between Franz and Reinhold.\n\n\nEvil\n‘Why do you let evil into your life?’ or rather, ‘Why was Reinhold1 in that bed?’. Why do you hang around with him at all? Why do you take part in his perverse habits, why do you spend so much time and energy enabling him?\nThis brings us to our secondary reading– evil begets evil, a sort of cultural determinist take on the motivations of the characters. A murderer gets out of prison, is welcomed back to his community– no wonder he returns to wickedness, when his evil is forgotten or ignored– violence is a valid form of communication. As I reread the book I will see how much this is the case.\n\n\nThe Man\nOne of the most striking features of the film (per the amount of domestic violence) is the dissonance between the fascination every character has with Franz, and the character himself. He is largely portrayed as a bumbling fool– his motivations are all over the place. His politics, inasmuch as he has them, are the sort of low-grade contrarianism that you see at QAnon rallies (or in more culturally appropriate parlance, he is a bit of a querdenker).\nIf the second half of the film drags (which it does), it might be a symptom of Fassbinders weakness for his characters, for giving them space and for using what they make of it. The amount of time we spend watching Franz and Mietze kissing and rolling around on the floor seems out of all proportion. In particular, in Ep.XIII, the moment of high drama is rendered almost absurd by the free form, presumably improvised dialogue between Mietze and Reinhold.\nBut, that brings me to another point– the first murder scene, the scene of Franz beating his wife to death, which is repeated many times. On a purely forensic viewing it would seem to exonerate Franz entirely. He does not beat her particularly badly, hitting her with a wooden spoon at some point, and slapping her a few times. But Fassbinder is not Michael Bay, his film does not live or die on the technical bombasity of the action– by having such a technically tepid main scene, the horror of what it represents is foregrounded.2\nOn this subject– maybe it suffers a little on the big screen. Maybe it is better as television– I’m thinking particularly of the amount of time Franz’s face is spelled out in five meters of flesh in front of you. Or is that brilliant? The butchery scene in the book is much quieter in the film– maybe this is Fassbinders butcher shop– the face, the plastic face that huge pregnant object."

Over the course of the next six months, the pot of cabbage didn’t move– while different generations, different species of mould battled for dominance over the interior, first a luxuriant green furry mould, then lower-profiled blues came in and held sway.

    "text": "Memories\nI arrived in Mumbai a week after I finished my final defense of my Masters. The moment I finished my masters I had started reading literature nonstop, and so I could hardly bring myself to remember to prepare in any way. I remember being in London before I left, reading Lady Chatterly’s Lover on a bus, dimly aware that something was about to happen. When I arrived in Mumbai airport I realised that I had neglected even to look at the city on google maps, so didn’t even have a vague outline cached on my phone. I couldn’t see evidence of a bus anywere, so I reluctantly queued for a taxi. In the taxi line I asked the people in front of and behind me what was a good district to get started in, and I promptly headed there.\nThe city was a chaos4. The taxi driver kept asking me where I wanted to go, and I kept responding with gestures trying to indicate bustle and saying ‘main street’ over and over again. I suppose he got the message, and eventually he gestured for me to get out. The city is a building site, a lot of it is either a slum or that sort of mixed-concrete-blocks, zoneless and haphazard. One of the first things I remember seeing from the highway as we descended into the city proper was a line of people walking along a long, steel passenger bridge, seeming to come from nowhere– might have been a swamp or so– and heading into a railway station, crammed with people. The first street I got out on was crammed wall to wall, and I rushed for the nearest coffee shop. The first one I found was some neoliberal dump, AC too high, possible south Korean inspired hypercapitalist decor. But they had wifi, so I could get my bearings.4 I vacillated on this repeatedly, almost maddeningly. Before I went, the horrorstories people had told me were so over the top that I basically expected piles of rotting corpses outside the airport. I responded to this with seeming to percieve the whole place as totally underwheling (not a realistic description of Mumbai). Then my first step out of the taxi was a moment of frank disbelief that this could be the main street of the ‘recommended’ district. (I later looked it up and it was indeed one of the nicer parts of town.) Then after my neoliberal latte and wifi, I strolled around feeling almost belligerently at peace (in fact after a week or so there, in order not to lost my mind, I started acting out my belligerent peace quite literally– finding no peace, I made it where I could– sat down in a square foot by a tree and read some poetry in the middle of the crowd– this is how you get by in India. Be belligerently okay with it all until you are.) Much later, after six weeks or so of intense self-imposed exile, when I went back into society to meet a friend, I suddenly had a moment of genuine calm– and I realised ‘wow, okay, it really did take me two full months to become in any way okay with this place’. I would not recommend anyone, even the most experienced traveller, to go to India for less than two months. The very idea that people do this is insane.\nI messaged some Couchsurfing hosts, had a look at the map, found some interesting looking places and set of to walk around.\nI was quite exhausted and still relatively5 poor, so my plan was to survive for the first month off $100, to set the tone for the rest of my journey. In order to achieve this, I cheated a little: I signed up for Vipassana.5 I have no illusions about being an unfortunate, but by the standards of europeans I was ‘pennyless’.\nI had heard about Vipassana from a few friends who had done it in Germany. I believe I went there with the perfect attitude: not expecting anything but a place to stay, but with my natural inclination to doing what is expected of me– I dilligently did whatever they asked, and had a fantastic experience. The Mumbai centers are presumably of a higher standard than those found elsewhere, and the calm oasis in the middle of such a throbbing megacity lent it a quite serious air. You felt like you were doing important business.\nAfter Vipassana, I foolishly moved to a hostel. This was in part to get some help in figuring out how to get a sim card, which was an enormous pain in the ass at the time. It was a quite horrible experience, especially after Vipassana, and I soon moved to an indian dorm6 where I could work on my reading in peace. It was $3-4 a day for the indian dorm and the bed came with a fan and a lock box. Quite fine, but I wasn’t in the mood for Mumbai– I had far too much reading with me for one thing.6 this was also essentially a hostel, or a capsule hotel, but I will tend to use the term ‘hostel’ for the kind of backpacker hostel you are familiar with"

My most lasting impression was this: why do so many young Europeans who want to experience the exotic, fly all the way to Mumbai or Delhi, when there is this fabulous exotic beast of a city right on their doorstep?

The 8 hours you spend crossing continents makes you feel like you are suitably far away. So flying what felt like ‘just across the pond’ and yet being somewhere so radically different– interesting!\nNote on the map, I downloaded my historical data from google maps, but unfortunately it was not as high resolution as I expected. A little disappointing, and I have now started using the OSM tracker, for future travel I will have better traces."

But, when we met some Expats in a bar in the center, one of them was from Aberdeen– they were all surprised at where we were staying, but when I asked him ‘but, do you really think it is more dangerous than Aberdeen or Glasgow’ he looked offended at the question and said ‘well of course not’.\nEverything is relative, and it is clear that the crime rates in Egypt are very moderate. To us, the district seemed exactly as it was– bustling with youthful exuberance– the transport in the district consisted almost entirely of teenagers in motorized tuktuks with ghetto blasters and LEDs drinking Pepsi, cruising.

It is a mix of carbs: rice, lentils, macaroni and chickpeas. But it isn’t all carbs! It’s also performance. Lets say you got the takeaway; once you have your mass of carbs (in a little grease-paper bowl, like a regular noodle box), you are also given the following: one large baggie of tomato sauce, one baggie of spicy sauce, one baggie of garlic sauce, and a baggy of fried onions.\nThe fun is in pouring your ingredients one after another onto your base, and then sprinkling the onions on top, and then consuming it in the fastest way possible.\n\n\nSandwiches\nWhile I do miss the koshary, for me the sandwiches were the real deal. In imagining them, start with a falafel sandwich. This is actually one of the options, and in many was similar (though superior) to what you would find in europe. Now however, I want you to shrink down the size of the piece of bread considerably, and I want you to remove all the contents, and replace it instead with one of the following: mashed potatoes, foul (refried kidney beans), fried aubergines, fried courgette, shakshuka– or one of the other options that I don’t know how to identify [V: Mousaka!]. So you have your tiny sandwhich with a little bit of friend beans inside it– eat it and have another! Order five if you like, they are cheap as chips and designed for fast, efficient, standing snacking– worthy of Mumbai.\nWalk on, don’t worry– you will see another sandwich place! And another!\n\n\nSweet Potatoes\nSlow cooked sweet potato with spices! Eat it hot, don’t think twice!\n\n\nBubble Tea"

However, Cairo is a fine city for the foot-goer, and we once managed to stumble into a beautiful old, crumbling dame of a hotel– the Nile Zamalek Hotel. We did what you are meant to do in these places, we ordered a room and stayed there for a week, forming a friendly, nodding acquaintance with the concierge and feeling like we were in a classic movie. There is something truly wonderful about finding a place to stay on foot, it will always beat planning, though planning is an occasional necessity."

    "text": "Do\nSee the pyramids! When I was first in Cairo I refused, or was too stoned and confused and suffering from akathisia or depressed or whatever you are at 20 years old when you haven’t really woken up yet. Well, not this time!\nVictoria wanted to go there and I said, ‘okay, but lets do it properly’. I knew it would be something of a horrorshow, with the skallys and hawkers and hustlers– shafting tourists is practically a national sport in Egypt8– so I thought we should spend at least a day hovering around the district to get the smell of the air. In the end, it was even better– we got a small hotel overlooking the compound and had a whole week basking in the ineffable glory of those monuments. What a place! Things are even stranger than you expect– you understand of course that there are still communities– travellers, performers, poorer districts in Ireland where the horse is still present, but the reality of this in a place like Giza is far odder than you would think.8 That is not to say that it is dangerous! Here are the brass tacks: in Egypt they are unlikely to assault or rob you as a tourist, but that does not meant that they will treat you with dignity and respect at every turn! In particular, the art of finding the ‘right price’ for things– and consistently getting it, requires constant work– a quick eye, a sharp wit, a good ear– and a mean streak! Because even if you do figure out the right price and some tricks for getting them, you then have to battle with your conscience– do you really want that tea and shisha for less than a dollar, when your monthly income is likely the same as they make in a year? (Short answer, its complicated– yes, often you do want the local price just on principle, but sometimes I find myself wishing I had lost the battle of the wits and gotten shafted a little harder. A delicious samosa in Mumbai from a kind hearted young man that set me back 10p was one of these occasions.)\nLet me set it up for you: in the Pyramids Complex– a patch of desert surrounded on all sides by a 10m high concrete wall topped with a 4m wire fence containing several pyramids and archeological sites and a deeply unpleasant, presumably 5-star restaurant– there are tourists with thier guides, and there are locals with their horses and camels. The tourists on tours are being sheparded by their guides and kept safe, but there are also roaving bands of lone tourists, all of whom are taxonomically designated as customers for the locals with their horses and camels. The selling of horse and camel rides through the Pyramids Complex seems to be the chief way that the locals benefit economically from their location. This setup, already familiar to me, seemed to my imagination as a classic High Octane Bad Vibe of the tourist-trap variety, and I was not eager to play the role that the locals would obviously want me to play. But enough about me– what I wanted to talk about was, what this setup does for local society. There is a second way in which locals benefit from the pyramids– they run guest houses. We stayed in one and it was very pleasant. But I get the impression that the number of people who hang around in Giza is slim. So what is left is a relatively impoverished district, literally in the shadow of one of the most stunning objects on the earth (and I have seen some things in my time), which has an economic incentive to handle large quantities of camels and horses.\nWhat I’m getting at here is that the entire district is an extended, sprawling stables. As a farm boy, this was very endearing to me, and I thoroughly enjoyed waking up to the sound of horses galloping in groups past my window. I enjoyed walking through the stable district 100m along the road from our guesthouse. I enjoyed the gangs of pre-teens you would occasionally see who had commandeered a carriage for the evening, barging around the streets with wild abandon. But most of all, I enjoyed the surly, 20-something Arab men who would cruise around town on horseback. This was something I never expected to enjoy so much, and never knew that I had missed! Until I saw it in Giza.\nTo give just a bit more context, if you walked for 8 or 9 minutes away from the Complex you would enter Giza proper. The area immediately around the Pyramids is exactly that sort of bizzaro-world that exists in third world countries around UNESCO sites, where the enormity of global inequality is most present, most palpable– and through which veil, one presumes (or one presumes the poor people in the area presume), a person could at these sites most easily pass. The shops have crazy prices and are run by increasingly villainous individuals the closer you get to the gate9. The sheer evil that flickered in the eye of the man who sold me a liter of water for two dollars 50m from the gate– was worth it of course, for the lesson in the shapes and forms of darkness. But if you turn away and walk into Giza, very quickly you will come across a highway, and once you have crossed that highway you are in a very regular part of Cairo. Poor but pround, happy to see you, strange sites on every corner.9 Exemplified most exquisitely by the KFC that sites directly across from the entrance to the complex– a glowing obelisk of the capitalocene facing off against eternity.\nVery regular except– for the young men on horseback.\nIt was beautiful to me not just because seeing people on horses doing regular people stuff, hanging out, going about the place, seemed like something that all humans should see– its something that was in our culture for millenia, and its a tragedy that we have lost it. But it was also an amusing and deeply characterful lesson in the force of– what to call it, inequality, situations, contingency. That this young man here, on this motorway divider, should be riding a horse about the place as if it was the most regular thing in the world– was due to the fact that tourists found it appropriate to see the pyramids from horseback, and had the cash to actualise their fantasies– and that this was so present, and so consistent that an entire community had grown around the pyramids, a large community of people who, against all odds, in a megacity populated in parts by teenagers in tuktuks high on pepsi, so lost was it in the stream of technofuturism– that here would be the first time I saw regular folks doing people stuff on horseback. Funny.\nThe story of the pyramids itself– a great place really– I will leave for another time."

    "text": "In order to get a new perspective on welfare, and taking a cue from Butler1, here I will review reasons to kill.\nTODO: make a set of metrics to judge these by, make a graph.\n\nSustenance [0.1]\nTo kill for food?\nThis justification dropped off a cliff during the agricultural revolution– at least w.r.t land animals.\nFor sea creatures I would argue that the justification for killing for eating continued at pace until the industrial revolution.\nThe reason sea creatures still merit our violent attentions is that they harvest food from all over the ocean and bring it to the shore, where we can harvest it. It is in this role as transporters of food that they earn their violence.\nThis also provides an interesting lens onto an ancient justification for hunting in general, before the majority of our environment was turned over to human activities– imagining wild animals move in a Brownian fashion, if a hunter-gatherer band sits in one place on the map and captures all wild animals that come their way, they are effectively expanding the plant capture area– especially considering wild animals often process food that is inedible for humans.\nHowever, the same could be said for land animals in certain communities. Eg. in agricultural communities, a diet supplemented with a bit of hunted and foraged food would be much richer than what agriculture alone could sustain.\nSo this probably retained some validity until well into the modern era– especially during eg. wartime periods.\n\n\nShelter [0.01]\nTo kill for clothing?\nThis has doubtless had some validity in certain places and times. It seems clear though that we can substitute very well for animal products in most places, since industrialization.\n\n\nPreference [0.001]\nTo kill for pleasure?\nHard to justify, especially since the advent of writing. Even before that we had art and poetry– there are other ways to entertain yourself.\nNote however the way preference interacts with eg. shelter– wearing real furs, no longer necessary, has social cache because eg. wearing the richest furs would have been a symbol of wealth and power since the early days of humanity, esp. in colder regions. You can see many evolutionary adaptations playing out in fashion in places like Moscow.\n\n\nConflict [0.6]\nThere are cases where the livelihood of animals is in direct conflict with the livelihood of persons2. An obvious example would be mosquitoes– whose livelihood is considered so irrelevant that we are seriously considering eliminating entire species. And we have successfully removed them en mass from eg. Taipei and other tropical cities where they would naturally thrive. Perhaps more interesting is the case of Seagulls and Pigeons, and other uneasy synanthropes– they would doubtless thrive even better if we didn’t build to exclude them, and aside from the corrosive effect of their shit, they don’t seem to do much harm. Maybe opening up cities to birds again would be an easy win for ‘wild animal’ welfare.\nWho else do we compete with directly these days? We prefer our shipping routes to the welfare of whales, and many other such conveniences. But most of the conflicts we have with animals seem to be agricultural. See for example Regenesis for a gloss of the research on wild animal-human encounters in national parks in Europe (w.r.t the question if we can’t live in harmony with wolves or boars).\n\n\nResearch [???]\nWe use animals for research. We use them to learn about the natural world, and to advance medicine in particular.\nThis subject has been treated in some detail by researchers already. TODO: read some relevant papers.\n\n\nIndustry\nAnimal products provide essential components in many industries. I think this topic would require the most careful scrutiny, as the question of relevant trade-offs in different cases might be quite nuanced. For example, if there is an animal product that is vastly more efficient to harvest than it takes to produce a substitute, how do we balance the choice?\n\n\nSport\nSee Section 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nread this↩︎\nOn a larger scale this includes most agriculture of course, but here we are talking even more directly.↩︎"

Then I grew up and moved to the big city, and climbed on slimy rooftops and up gutters. Then I became civilized, and went to university.\nWhile studying for a Physics MSc. I worked for three years in a molecular biophysics laboratory developing microscopy techniques for studying DNA-protein interactions, including hardware and software engineering and a little bit of wetlab work. After taking a year out to further develop my programming skills I’m now working as a python programmer in a tech startup.\nI was civilized by artists in Leipzig, they took me in and told me how to survive in the 21st century.

It is hard to compete with advances of that size, no matter how good our movies and kitchen appliances become.”\nNow they are trying to get me to join the bandwagon? “This all presents a compelling opportunity. Given its nascent state and the lack of serious full-time Progress Studies researchers, we–meaning anyone reading this document, meaning you–each have good odds of being able to substantially shape the course of this field. 25 How should we approach field-building? One approach is straightforward: publish good research, then label it Progress Studies, and simply assert that it is part of a new intellectual tradition. In contrast, my work here thus entails the beginning of an even more straightforward approach: 1. Robustly argue for foundational assumptions 2. Define operationalizations of key concepts 3. Set and enforce epistemic norms”\nQuite tempting actually.\n\n\nOur World in Data\nhas tonnes of stuff and are generally the best combination of gung-ho and data-heavy.\nSee the thread about drama with Justin Hickel for some relevant (and juicy) context.\n\n\nAgainst Wage Stagnation\nI would say that a huge amount of focus is placed on the situation in the US. There is some sense to this since they are leading the charge in GDP, but it should not be over-emphasized.\nReview\n\n\nDevelopment\nI read a lot about development. I want to organize my thoughts and my reading about this a little better.\n\n\nEconomic Growth\nAgain and again I see the idea that economic growth is good, that it drags people out of poverty, that it improves quality of life.\nMore importantly, it often seems like all the things that people want correlate with economic growth. So, even if you are unsatisfied with it as a metric for human wellbeing or happiness or anything else, finding another way of measuring what you ‘really want’ would be a waste of time because GDP already measures what you think you really want to measure. And there is already a tonne of research literature about it, so trying to create a new index and create a new body of literature on your new, improved index would be a huge waste of time.\nOf course if you can invent a wellbeing index that doesn’t correlate strongly with GDP then you will have something significant. But such a thing doesn’t seem to exist.\nHere is a good article that covers a lot of this stuff quite nicely: Economic Growth in 5 Figures.\nThere are also various things from eg. Our World in Data that cover this.\n\n\nThe issue\nThe issue is, many of my dear friends seem to disagree about this. But whenever I try to get to the heart of the disagreement, I get lost.\n\n\nCurrent work\nRead Donna Haraway’s Staying With the Trouble and try to see where the biggest points of difference between my worldview and hers are.\n\n\nOther reading\nI want to read Caliban and the Witch again, I have important disagreements with some of it. I want to read some books by Iam Morris. Though they seem to be largely things I would agree with, I want to check my methods and facts."

Here are some examples of things you could spend time on. Nothing on this list is a requirement, nor are you expected to do all this. These are just examples of things that you could spend time on. - Use this website to keep track of opportunities. Apply liberally, dont expect to get accepted to the majority of things. Other sources (will overlap): - https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/opportunities - AI safety support slack #opportunities channel - Do the AGISF. The curriciulum is open, so you can do it by your own or with a friend. - Probably will want to learn some practical ML. This Course I reccomend. - spend a minority of time reading stuff on alignment forum / lesswrong that you find interesting. Start building an inside model - Use the AI safety support resources: They have a newsletter, a list of resources. Furthermore, you can read JJ’s posts on “Getting started independently in AI safety” and “The application is not the applicant”. - I reccomend the https://alignmentjam.com/ hackathons if you wanna get started doing something. Might need some ML first. - General skillbuilding is great if you enjoy it. Doing supervised research or internship can be a good use of your time even if its non-alignment related. - Take care of yourself. Spend as much time on these things as you find fun/interesting/meaningful and can afford and no more :)\n\nBibliography\nTaskonomy"
