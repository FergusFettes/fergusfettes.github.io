    "text": "Leipzig Apartments\n\nPizzalab, George Schwartz Str.\nProject house that I volunteered at (with my brother). ### Dancers Sublet, Lindenauer Markt ### The Castle, Duerenberger Str. ### Merseburger 108 Sub-squat grade dwelling. The room I took was vacated hastily due to a stabbing in the neighboring room. Perhaps 30 or 40 people lived there, some in apartments, some (like me) in rooms that opened onto the corridors generally, using some of the shared toilets and bathrooms in the building. The shared rooms often lacked luxuries like glass in the panes or locking doors. An example anecodte of many– when I moved in, the kitchen had recently been inexplicably cleaned. Someone had cooked a pot of cabbage. Over the course of the next six months, the pot of cabbage didn’t move– while different generations, different species of mould battled for dominance over the interior, first a luxuriant green furry mould, then lower-profiled blues came in and held sway. I went in there every morning at 6am to boil a liter of water for my daily thermos of coffee, but apart from that limited my contact with the surfaces and spaces. ### Merseburger 95 Moved in with my partner2 for a few months. However she enjoyed having more space, so I soon tried to find ‘alternative’ accomodation. ### Factory behind Lidl Moved into an abandoned factory with a friend. We had a little camping gear and found a nice building made of wood, amongst the trees. Somehow, incredibly, he couldn’t keep the place clean– despite there being an enormous hole in the floor where we could just toss rubbish. This was beyond him. ### Dannis House Moved in with an old street musician. This was a litany of small communication disasters. ### Henrietten Str. Moved to a very regular WG. Was finishing my masters at the time and therefore quite focussed. ### Merseburger 95 A room opened up in my partners flat and I took it. I stayed there for a year or so after that, my longest stay since merse 108."

In an effort to start making progresson that and to start gathering some material, I will start doing small autobiographical reviews of some megacities that have made an impression on me.\nFor now, I am defining a megacity as ’any city with a metro population at or above Paris/London as defined by this pdf.1[^UNREAD]\n\nTokyo-Yokohama\n\n\nJakarta [memories]\nSpent some time here as a child. I remember taxi rides through dusty highways between skyscrapers, and the golden candle in the center– there was lots of kite-flying. We went to a karaeoke bar and heard a philippino band singing american rock and roll– probably the first live rock music I heard in my life was in bars in Jakarta. # Delhi [memories, map] # Mumbai [memories, map] # Manila # Shanghai [memories] # Sao Paulo # Seoul-Incheon # Mexico City # Guangzhou-Foshan [memories] # New York [memories] # Beijing [memories, footage?, opinions?] The first city I lived in as an ‘independent’2.\n\n\nConclusions\nI have spent well over a year in megacities– a short time when compared to a random sample of the world population3.\nI have visited [16/34] of the worlds megacities. There are around 10 more that are high on my list which I should get to in the next decade. I think Moscow and Tehran are the only major difficulties– but I am writing this in the time of the Mahsa Amini protests so lets see.\nI feel like there is a lot to be learned about megacities and I look forward to expanding this page.\n\n\nBibliography\nThe Death and Life of Great American Cities\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nIf that seems unecessary and unfair to Tianjin, I would say that in part the only reason I am including Paris and London on the list at all is they provide a relevant reference point for certain people, not because I think they are defining members of the megacity class.↩︎\nI was still living off my parents money for the first few months, and off my other privilidges for much longer. # Cairo [memories, map, sleep, drink, eat, districts] # Kolkata # Moscow # Bangkok [memories] # Buenos Aires # Shenzhen [memories] # Dhaka # Los Angeles # Lagos # Istanbul # Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto # Karachi # Bangalore [memories, map] # Tehran # Kinshasa # Ho Chi Minh City [memories] # Rio de Janeiro # Chennai [memories, map] # Chengdu [memories] # Lahore # Paris [memories] # London [memories, map, eat, districts]↩︎\ndoes this mean anything?↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In order to get a new perspective on welfare, and taking a cue from Butler1, here I will review reasons to kill.\nTODO: make a set of metrics to judge these by, make a graph.\n\nSustenance [0.1]\nTo kill for food?\nThis justification dropped off a cliff during the agricultural revolution– at least w.r.t land animals.\nFor sea creatures I would argue that the justification for killing for eating continued at pace until the industrial revolution.\nThe reason sea creatures still merit our violent attentions is that they harvest food from all over the ocean and bring it to the shore, where we can harvest it. It is in this role as transporters of food that they earn their violence.\nThis also provides an interesting lens onto an ancient justification for hunting in general, before the majority of our environment was turned over to human activities– imagining wild animals move in a Brownian fashion, if a hunter-gatherer band sits in one place on the map and captures all wild animals that come their way, they are effectively expanding the plant capture area– especially considering wild animals often process food that is inedible for humans.\nHowever, the same could be said for land animals in certain communities. Eg. in agricultural communities, a diet supplemented with a bit of hunted and foraged food would be much richer than what agriculture alone could sustain.\nSo this probably retained some validity until well into the modern era– especially during eg. wartime periods.\n\n\nShelter [0.01]\nTo kill for clothing?\nThis has doubtless had some validity in certain places and times. It seems clear though that we can substitute very well for animal products in most places, since industrialization.\n\n\nPreference [0.001]\nTo kill for pleasure?\nHard to justify, especially since the advent of writing. Even before that we had art and poetry– there are other ways to entertain yourself.\nNote however the way preference interacts with eg. shelter– wearing real furs, no longer necessary, has social cache because eg. wearing the richest furs would have been a symbol of wealth and power since the early days of humanity, esp. in colder regions. You can see many evolutionary adaptations playing out in fashion in places like Moscow.\n\n\nConflict [0.6]\nThere are cases where the livelihood of animals is in direct conflict with the livelihood of persons2. An obvious example would be mosquitoes– whose livelihood is considered so irrelevant that we are seriously considering eliminating entire species. And we have successfully removed them en mass from eg. Taipei and other tropical cities where they would naturally thrive. Perhaps more interesting is the case of Seagulls and Pigeons, and other uneasy synanthropes– they would doubtless thrive even better if we didn’t build to exclude them, and aside from the corrosive effect of their shit, they don’t seem to do much harm. Maybe opening up cities to birds again would be an easy win for ‘wild animal’ welfare.\nWho else do we compete with directly these days? We prefer our shipping routes to the welfare of whales, and many other such conveniences. But most of the conflicts we have with animals seem to be agricultural. See for example Regenesis for a gloss of the research on wild animal-human encounters in national parks in Europe (w.r.t the question if we can’t live in harmony with wolves or boars).\n\n\nResearch [???]\nWe use animals for research. We use them to learn about the natural world, and to advance medicine in particular.\nThis subject has been treated in some detail by researchers already. TODO: read some relevant papers.\n\n\nIndustry\nAnimal products provide essential components in many industries. I think this topic would require the most careful scrutiny, as the question of relevant trade-offs in different cases might be quite nuanced. For example, if there is an animal product that is vastly more efficient to harvest than it takes to produce a substitute, how do we balance the choice?\n\n\nSport\nSee Section 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nread this↩︎\nOn a larger scale this includes most agriculture of course, but here we are talking even more directly.↩︎"

This album always reminded me in a remarkably clear way of music bars in HongKong and the kind of tragic ex-pats that would end up there.

It’s actually quite different from what I expected. I mean I know I listen to a lot of solo piano music, but that is a little absurd. And how did John Cale get in there as second!\nThe more I look at that list the more perplexing I find it. I guess I did download a lot of music this year and listen to it on my laptop, so the numbers are quite a bit skewed by that. But that still means that I have listened to 16h or the Polyrythmic Orchestra of Cotonou!\nThe only thing I find totally unrealistic is the 12h of Brahms and the 8h of Beethoven– they must both be from the Menuhin Century album– the ‘Virtuoso and Landmark Recordings’ CDs are full of Brahms and Beethoven, and I listen to it regularly. But in my defense I’m mostly in it for the Menuhin– those two plus the Shostakovich– and maybe even the Rachmaninoff? I think there are a few names on there because of that album.\n\nPodcasts\nHere are the top podcast times:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf = sort_df_by_artist_time(podcast_df)\ndf.head(30).style.hide_index()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Artist\n      Time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      80,000 Hours Podcast with Rob Wiblin\n      23h:20m\n    \n    \n      Conversations with Tyler\n      17h:21m\n    \n    \n      The Ezra Klein Show\n      10h:30m\n    \n    \n      Dan Carlin's Hardcore History\n      10h:12m\n    \n    \n      The Lunar Society\n      4h:12m\n    \n    \n      Sean Carroll's Mindscape: Science, Society, Philosophy, Culture, Arts, and Ideas\n      1h:57m\n    \n    \n      Lex Fridman Podcast\n      1h:26m"

A lot of the hours that Liszt has racked up are due to the album ‘Harmonies poétiques et religieuses’, which, I have to admit, has failed to really hit home with me. I spent many hours with the album, as you can see, because I have had good luck with other long Liszt suites (such as the Annees), just by listening to them again and again until they start to sink in. But the Harmonies still haven’t settled in, in fact I hardly remember them, which is why I was so surprised that Liszt was so high on the numbers for the last year.\nLo-Pacific by the Sun City Girls is great, but is an entire album as a single track so is cheating a little bit.\nWhat is Kansas by Opinion? I have never heard of that. Apparently it is on a playlist I created though, so apparently I listened to it and liked it once upon a time– or rather, 4 times upon a time, since it is 30 mins long. I’ll drop it too.\nIf I remove the classical stuff and Lo-Pacific, then the top tracks looks like this:\n\nTop Tracks (All)Top Tracks (Non-Classical)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf = sort_df_by_track(listening_df)\n\n# Show columns in the order 'Track', 'Artist', 'Time'\ndf = df[['Track', 'Artist', 'Time']]\ndf.head(30).style.hide_index()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Track\n      Artist\n      Time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \"J\" Blues 72\n      Shin Joong Hyun\n      3h:36m\n    \n    \n      Harmonies poétiques et religieuses, S. 173: III.

Then I grew up and moved to the big city, and climbed on slimy rooftops and up gutters. Then I became civilized, and went to university.\nWhile studying for a Physics MSc. I worked for three years in a molecular biophysics laboratory developing microscopy techniques for studying DNA-protein interactions, including hardware and software engineering and a little bit of wetlab work. After taking a year out to further develop my programming skills I’m now working as a python programmer in a tech startup.\nI was civilized by artists in Leipzig, they took me in and told me how to survive in the 21st century. I’m now living in Vienna, continuing to learn these lessons."
