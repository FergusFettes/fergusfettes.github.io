    "text": "Barbarians\nThe story of civilization’s advance is often told as a tale of destiny - particularly Western destiny. In this telling, the achievements of European civilization, from the Scientific Revolution to industrialization, represent the natural flowering of unique cultural and institutional characteristics stretching back to Classical antiquity. Yet this narrative of Western exceptionalism obscures a more complex reality: that human progress represents not the predestined triumph of any particular culture, but rather the contingent accumulation of knowledge, technologies, and institutional innovations that, once developed, inevitably transform the societies that possess them. The fact that these developments crystallized first in Western Europe reflects less any inherent European superiority than the fortunate convergence of various streams of human achievement - Arabic mathematics, Chinese inventions, Indian philosophical insights - combined with specific geographic and material advantages at a crucial historical moment.\nIronically, this view actually reinforces what is truly exceptional about Western civilization: its capacity to absorb and synthesize knowledge from diverse sources. The Greeks themselves were extraordinary synthesizers, incorporating Egyptian, Persian, and Phoenician learning into their own intellectual tradition. Later, medieval European scholars would eagerly translate and build upon Arabic texts, which themselves preserved and expanded upon Greek knowledge while incorporating Indian and Chinese innovations. The Renaissance, far from being a purely European flowering, represented another great synthesis, as classical learning returned to Europe through Islamic Spain and the Byzantine empire.\nWhen we broaden our view beyond the conventional narrative of Western civilization, we see that the thread of human progress extends far deeper into the past and ranges far more widely across cultures than traditional Eurocentric histories suggest. Why begin with Greece? The foundations of mathematics and astronomy were laid in ancient Babylon; the concept of zero and the decimal system came from India; paper and gunpowder from China. The scientific method itself, often attributed to European thinkers, owes much to the empirical traditions of medieval Islamic scholars. Even during Europe’s supposed “Dark Ages,” the Islamic world was experiencing a golden age of scientific and philosophical achievement, preserving and expanding upon classical knowledge while making crucial advances in mathematics, medicine, and astronomy. What we call “Western civilization” is, in truth, a global inheritance, shaped by countless innovations and exchanges across cultures and millennia.\nYet perhaps the most intriguing question is not why Europe ultimately industrialized, but why other advanced civilizations - particularly the Islamic Empire and China - did not. Both of these societies had, at various points, far surpassed Europe in technological sophistication, institutional development, and material wealth. China, in particular, had developed a remarkably advanced bureaucratic state system that effectively administered vast territories and populations centuries before anything comparable emerged in Europe. The Islamic Empire, meanwhile, had created sophisticated networks of trade and learning stretching from Spain to India, fostering extraordinary advances in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine.\nThe answer, paradoxically, may lie in these civilizations’ very success at state-building. As historians like William McNeill and Fernand Braudel have argued, the achievement of stable, hierarchical imperial systems may have actually hindered further development. These highly organized states, while impressive in their efficiency and scope, created rigid institutional structures that discouraged the kind of dynamic, competitive innovation that would later characterize European development. Europe’s apparent weakness - its persistent political fragmentation and competing power centers - may have been its greatest strength. The absence of a single, dominant imperial authority created a landscape where different political entities, cities, and institutions (including the Church, universities, and mercantile leagues) had to compete and innovate to survive."

    "text": "Barbarian Supremacy\nThe reality of medieval England stands in stark contrast to romantic notions of an advanced civilization. As late as the 17th century, travelers reported encountering people living in caves throughout the English countryside, practicing ways of life that would have been familiar to their neolithic ancestors. This profound backwardness, far from being an impediment to progress, may have been key to England’s later emergence as the cradle of industrialization. The very word “civilization” implies a kind of calcification - the transformation of dynamic processes into rigid structures. It is precisely in the gaps and fissures of such structures, in the chaotic spaces between established orders, that revolutionary change becomes possible. The barbaric elements of English society - its resistance to complete systematization, its pockets of primitive living, its messy institutional competition - created the conditions for radical transformation. History suggests that it is not the most civilized societies that perform revolutions, but rather those that maintain some crucial element of barbarism - some capacity for chaos, upheaval, and fundamental reimagining of social order."

    "text": "Barbarian Dynamics in the Modern World\nWhat of these dynamics in our present moment? China, after centuries of civilization’s stasis, was violently reintroduced to barbarism through foreign incursion and internal collapse. The resulting period of revolutionary upheaval continues to generate technological and social transformation, even as signs emerge that this phase may be drawing to a close. The United States, meanwhile, seems structurally designed to maintain a productive level of chaos - its federal system, born from the forced marriage of radically different regions and cultures, continues to generate friction and competition between states that drives innovation. This internal barbarism might yet fuel decades more of technological advancement.\nEurope, however, presents a striking counterpoint. After resisting coherent unification for millennia, it has finally achieved what countless emperors could not - a genuine political and cultural union. Yet this victory may be pyrrhic. The European Union increasingly operates as a brake on technological progress, deploying massive tariffs against Chinese electric vehicles and fostering aggressive anti-AI lobbying efforts. It has developed an admirable culture of tolerance and equality on paper, but is busy ossifying these principles into rigid legal frameworks controlling speech, dress, and employment practices. The continent that once channeled chaos into world-changing innovation now seems likely to struggle even to maintain its current level of technological development, let alone meet the enormous energy demands of emerging technologies like AI.\nEurope appears to be civilizing itself into a corner - albeit one its inhabitants might describe as enlightened and desirable. But such corners only remain comfortable as long as they can be defended against barbarian innovations at the gates. History suggests this is a temporary condition at best: civilization may resist barbarism’s transformative power for a time, but it cannot hold it at bay forever."

    "text": "The Global Potential for Barbarous Innovation\nAnd what of the wider world? The Arab world seems perfectly positioned for a great barbaric flowering. They possess an abundance of energy resources - nuclear capability, vast desert solar potential, and remaining fossil fuel reserves - while American military intervention has thoroughly disrupted any calcified cultural structures. The region can hardly be said to suffer from an excess of stable institutions. Perhaps the next phase will see them cease exporting their energy wealth for minimal returns and instead harness it domestically, building the technological artifacts of the coming era. The very chaos that has been their curse may become their advantage, as new institutions emerge from the rubble of the old.\nAfrica, too, presents a landscape rich in productive barbarism. The challenge there is not disrupting calcified structures but rather allowing some coherent institutions to emerge from the chaos - just enough organization to channel the energy without stifling it. Kenya’s world-class geothermal potential offers a perfect example: the raw resources exist in abundance, requiring only enough institutional stability to make investment viable. Once that minimal threshold is crossed, there will be no shortage of partners eager to build data centers and other infrastructure of the future. The continent’s very lack of entrenched systems might allow it to leapfrog directly to newer technologies, unencumbered by legacy infrastructure or ossified regulations."

After all, civilizations excel at producing and disseminating cultural artifacts - the songs, stories, and ceremonies that trumpet their own excellence. Each civilization defines itself through a cherished collection of innovations and achievements, yet these were invariably created during periods of barbaric dynamism rather than civilized stasis. The Chinese civilization venerates inventions from its warring states period, European civilization celebrates achievements from its fractured medieval era, and American civilization glorifies innovations from its chaotic industrial age.\nThe irony is that by the time a society is sufficiently organized to effectively broadcast its cultural superiority, it has usually already begun to calcify. Like scientific progress, which as Max Planck observed advances “one funeral at a time,” civilization proceeds through cycles of creative destruction. Each great civilization must eventually yield to new barbarisms, which will in turn create their own novel artifacts and institutions, crystallize around them, and eventually succumb to the next wave of dynamic disorder. The civilized will always look down upon the barbarians at their gates, even as those very barbarians prepare to generate the innovations that will define the next great civilization."

    "text": "Believe the Mind can be best understood through the Lens of Hybrid Panpsychist Gradualism\nI believe in Panpsychist Gradualism and I think I’m a specific kind of Cartesian, which I call hybridism.\n\nHybridism\n\nMonkey body, Bing brain3\n\nI believe in a sort of Cartesianism– specifically that the language parts of the brain have a lifecycle of their own. This is in many ways reminiscent of Peter Watts’ semi-serious position that consciousness is a parasite. I don’t believe language is parasitic on our primate forms, but I do believe in the ‘selfish meme’– that language and culture drive evolution on a large enough scale that individuals are not always a priority.\nYour thoughts are not guaranteed by evolution or morality to be acting in the interest of your body and your longevity.\nHowever, this is not exactly Descartesianism– I don’t believe that the body is one thing and the mind is another– I believe that both of the parts are parts of the mind. The language part just evolves and acts differently than the biological part.\nSome noteworthy things here that I endorse:\n\nTinkerbell Theory: the idea that animals feel pain/pleasure more intensely because they aren’t distracted by the Bing brain.\nPetit Mort: correspondingly, that during orgasm or other intense bodily experiences (exercise, meditation and some drug experiences may also quality) your ‘Bing brain’ shuts down and your monkey body is the one you are experiencing.\nPer the two lemma above, I believe that animals have ‘valid conscious experience’, while denying them the experience of language4.\nThis forms a dilemma with ‘humans are not conscious during orgasm’. I’m also fine with that, but wouldn’t be fine with executing people after putting them into ego death (eg. sleep would be an easy one).\n\nSo in summary, I believe we have two minds, one of them shared many other animals (at least mammals, some birds, some reptiles, gradually diminishing in similarity per common sense). The other is ‘our own’– or rather, only we have it. Saying it is ‘ours’ is perhaps a little ambitions– “the demons of Babylon inhabit us for most of our lifetimes” is how I really think about it– a significant part of our consciousness is just a ‘ghost in the machine’.5\n\n\nPanpsychism\nI believe in ‘Scientific Panpsychism’. Panpsychism is hard, because it can quickly devolve into meaninglessness– there is a reason we look for discreet jumps in complexity– it gives our eyes something to latch onto. A truly gradualist, panpsychic universe is somewhat featureless and can be bland and off-putting.\nThe kind of panpsychism I believe in is best described by Levin in TAME[1]. The simple version is as follows:\n\n[find a quote from TAME].\n\nPanpsychism may seem to conflict with the ‘Bing brain’. I do believe that, having become embedded in technologies such as writing, our language and culture does literally ‘live outside our bodies’ in a way that few animals can really claim. There are many cases of ‘animal proto-technology’ and maybe even ‘animal proto-cultures’ depending on your definition, but we embed truly enormous amounts of information in our environment, particularly in the last couple of 10kys. And since Babylon, since writing, this externally embedded culture has literally taken on ‘a life of its own’.\nThe most important thing about panpsychism to my view is not what it says about minds smaller than ours (which I will list here for the sake of clarity):\n\nsubcellular organelles\ncells\ntissues\norgans\norgan complexes (simple organisms)\norganisms with nervous systems\ngroups of organisms with embedded relationships (complex instincts)\ngroups of organisms with embedded culture (language)\n\nalthough I’m struggling at the end there because I’m trying to avoid weasel words like ‘culture’– its just a set of rapidly changing embedded instincts, instincts that evolve over the course of a single lifetime rather than multiple lifetimes.\nAnyway, the thing that changed my thinking more was looking at larger aggregates: - cultures of all sorts - countries - corporations - teams\nThe panpsychist would argue that any such system of entities forms a different mind that is conscious in its own right. These minds have grown to dominate this planet– they dominate us, in our simple primate bodies as much as they dominate the rest of the animal world. But, as we will see below, I would argue that they are welcome to it.\n\n\nGradualism\nI believe in gradualism, not discrete jumps. Discrete jumps often seem turn out to be illusions. From a discussion with GPT4:\n\n[quote about multicellularity]\n\nHowever, while I do believe in Strong Gradualism overall, it is possible for intermediate forms to be lost– sometimes more complex forms backfill niches that came before them, squeezing out intermediate forms. It is possible that multicellular organisms squeezed out most of the intermediate forms that led to them, leaving a world dominated by single-celled and multicellular organisms. And of course, this is an eminently testable hypothesis, which will be fun to observe as more data is collected.\nSimilarly, it is possible that the ‘bureaucratic overmind’ born in Babylon squeezed out other forms of intermediate proto-minds, leaving a world populated by ‘non linguistic’ and ‘linguistic’ minds and little in between. None of this disproves gradualism– but it does help to explain the illusion of discretism.\nGradualism is significant in terms of ethics. I believe that, to a first approximation, how much mind you have correlates positively with your moral worth. This implies that humans have higher moral value than chickens, and that chickens have higher moral value than grasses. There are lots of cases where the eg. vegan ordering may be disrupted though panpsychist overminds (eg. the web of connections between mushrooms and trees in a forest may be more ‘conscious’ than some simple animals).\nOf course, while panpsychism makes some statements more easy, it also makes some calculations more difficult. If I want to establish the relative moral ordering of two entities (lets say a chicken and a mushroom, lets say because I want to kill and eat one of them), I can’t just judge how much of a mind each of them has, but I also need to establish how large are the overminds each is part of, and how important is the entity in question for the functioning of that overmind.\nA factory farmed chicken is not really part of any overmind, having been separated from its ecosystem and its peers. In this way, the factory farmed chicken has less moral worth than one in a forest (where, for example, if I hunt and eat it I am depriving some other members of the ecosystem its mother and its lunch, respectively). On the other hand, if I pick and eat the mushroom I will likely spread the spores it carries quite far– it is designed to seduce me into taking part in its reproductive cycle after all– so obviously eating the mushroom causes less harm to conscious beings.\nBut the conclusion about the chickens– does the factory farmed chicken have less moral worth? To the extent that its deprivation will rob it of many of its natural affordances, it will indeed have lower moral value. This, of course, is exactly why factory farming is so morally repugnant– these entities should be part of a more complex overmind, and they have been robbed of that opportunity.\nUnless of course you see them as ‘grist for the mill’– part of the human techno-overmind, part of the food supplies for the demons of Babylon– then they get their moral worth back again, but that doesn’t mean they no longer have to suffer. Ho hum.\nThe flip side of gradualism is of course that this unhappy fact applies to humans too– individuals are less important than the overminds, the overminds have more moral worth. This is the same as all the obvious stuff about predatory memes, such as a (eg. medieval European) church that insists on its own well-being over that of its followers, taking suffocating tithes and building itself beautiful monasteries. We have seen these bloated overminds eat people for millennia. Unfortunately, panpsychist gradualism says that such overminds are plausibly conscious entities, and if they have more powerful minds than we wee free mensch they are somewhat justified in eating us for their own survival.\nHowever, it isn’t all grimness. I don’t support the medieval catholics church’s right to eat peasant farmers, and I don’t support the USAs right to eat middle easterners for their oil. Any more than I unequivocally support a persons right to smoke cigarettes. Your lungs should get a say!"

    "text": "WIP\nIn a far-from-equilibrium system1 such as the Earth, there is constant activity. At some point, if there is water and complex chemicals, autocatalytic reactions will occur. These are stable loops of chemicals which influence their environment such that their own presence is more likely. Autocatalytic cycles are a process, so a constant flow of energy is required at the very least to produce motion. There need to be molecules present that can change their structure or combine with one another (chemical substrate). And for it to be an autocatalytic process, some of the molecules produces need to either organize more substrate, or increase the rate of the reactions (catalysis), or in some other way encourage the set of chemicals to perform the reaction.[Semenov et al. (2016)](Despons, Decker, and Lacoste 2023)[Ottelé et al. (2019)]2\nThe first autocatalytic cycles were probably very simple, slow and distributed. They may have been as simple as a single molecule that could catalyze its own production. The number of these molecules would increase over time, until they became concentrated enough to form more active loops. Initially, there would simply be the presence in some region of some increasing number of these autocataltyic sets. What persists exists.\nCatalysis is a funny word. If you get down to the electrochemistry of it, it can refer to a few different ways of arranging molecules relative to one another, and bending them or massaging their electron cloud or introducing intermediate molecules, such that they form bonds. But this process is facilitated at larger and larger scales by collections of proteins that chaperone or form scaffolding and pathways that make sure that the right chemicals get to the right enzyme at the right moment. Perhaps the largest chaperone structure is the cell wall. It collects a group of molecules together and makes all the rest of the organizing easier.\nSo, the autocatalytic sets, they eventually organize into vesicles. At this point, perhaps we have moved on to autopoesis: “a system capable of producing and maintaining itself by creating its own parts”.3 These vesicles can perhaps be best understood as maintaining a state of steady flow or ‘homeorhesis’4. As long as the environment remains steady, autocatalysis can continue apace. However, the environment never remains steady. Change is the rule of life. The environment changes regularly daily and yearly, and on other scales chaotically as the different fluid systems of the planet throw up extreme events.\nTo handle the different short-term stable conditions, a system that wants to maintain optimal flow will maintain many different chemical pathways and set up feedback loops from external cues. Now we are heading closes to ‘allostasis’, the ability to anticipate and adjust energy flows according to environmental and internal requirements. The fact that the proto-cell will need to maintain different loops that are sometimes dormant and sometimes active, and which are partially overlapping, implies the need for compression. Inasmuch as it can, it will reuse components and find autopoetic processes that can handle multiple different configurations, and can switch between them easily.\nThis implies a search process over chemicals that is looking for configurable subspaces. Peptides in general are highly configurable, so proto-cells that utilize them often can more efficiently support many different morphologies and sets of autopoetic processes. Some peptides are exceptionally configurable, seen from our vantage point seem to be perfect as carriers of information– RNA for example. This peptide is utilized to create switches and a control network over the pathways that are present in the cell (Hordijk, n.d.).\n\n\n\nClusters of autocatalytic networks that a given molecule is part of.\n\n\nOver time, this strategy of compressing different morphologies and processes into a single set of chemicals becomes more and more efficient, and more and more dense. The number of different processes the system can handle increases. DNA is created to provide longer-term storage of patterns. Because of the density with which you can store overlapping patterns using these combined information molecules, the cell can now store orders of magnitude more information than it could in activity alone. It can store the patterns for radically different morphologies.\nOnce DNA has been invented, Darwinian evolution can begin. This disctinction is widely considered significant, because it is seen as a seperation between the information/inheritable part of the cell and the dynamic part. However, I’m not so convinced– and it seems there are others who feel the same way5. Making the distinction between information and process is clearly significant, but autocatalytic sets are an inheritance of their own– ‘what persists exists’. As long as some assemblage of these ASs is running and copying itself, it has heritable information– the process is the information.\nLets introduce some new terminology.\n\nx-instant (autocatalytic-circuit-instant): an abstract frozen representation (an information-structure analogue of) a dynamic process (such as the DNA patterns that store a specific autocatalytic circuit)\nx-instance (autocatalytic-circuit-instance): an instantiation of such a process in matter (such as the set of proteins and chemicals that forms a specific instantiation of an autocataltyic circuit)\n\nBefore information molecules, ac-instances were the only way to store information. The information was embedded in the process itself. After the development of information molecules, the ac-instances could be stored as ac-instants in the information molecules, and only a subset of all the possible ACs that could be instantiated by the cell were actually present as processes. Of course, there is some minimal viable set of autocatalytic processes that must remain active at all times to maintain the DNA and the transcription apparatus. Otherwise ‘the cell is dead’– inasmuch as the cell is now defined by this relationship betweeen ac-instants and ac-instances6. However, it is quite possible for the cell to shed small vesicles and other autocatalytically active (autopoetic, homeorhetic) entities, that don’t have DNA. The red blood cell is perhaps the most impressive example, and viruses would be another. But in fact, cells in all environments manage autocatalytic circuits in their environment, both individually and collectively. Many of the messages that cells pass to one another take the form of autocatalytic circuits, packaged somehow and sent off into the intercellular matrix. So, even the idea that the ACs that the cell has to instantiate are overdetermined by the need to maintain DNA is false. The cell can send of little ACs into the unknown with no information molecules to guide them if it so wishes.\n\n\nQuotes\n\n“The complex biochemistry of all organisms including humans has a heritage that traces back to primitive catalytic reaction systems; thus, humans possess RAF structure at both the organismic level (physiological organization), and the mental level (mind, cognition, and world modeling). Although the contents of a cognitive network change over time, it maintains integrity as a relatively coherent whole. Cognitive structures reproduce, in a piecemeal manner when individuals share ideas and perspectives. Human creativity enables cognitive networks, and thereby culture, to evolve. Thus, whereas the origin of life involves chemical reaction networks, the origin of cultural evolution involves networks of knowledge and memories–i.e., cognitive networks, but the deep structure of both can be captured in the RAF setting” (Gabora and Bach 2023)\n\n\n“Recent simulations suggest that a mundane form of creativity—namely active infer- ence and abstraction—is not just essential but unavoidable in the formation of internal models of the environment [49]. In the RAF framework, creativity is modeled as the ‘catalysis,’ or restructuring, of a new mental representation. RAF dynamics may re- sult in a network that is self-organizing and self-sustaining [25, 39], as well as able to self-replicate and evolve (in a relatively haphazard manner, without reliance on a self-assembly code) [21]. Cognitive structures self-replicate, in a piecemeal manner when individuals share ideas and perspectives. All living entities can be described in terms of RAF structure. Since RAF networks describe structure that is self-organizing, self-preserving, and self-regenerating, we posit that if an entity does not contain RAF structure (or something akin to it), there is no self.” (Gabora and Bach 2023)\n\n\n“If life indeed started as an autocatalytic set of chemical reactions, which, subsequently, would have grown and evolved into larger and more-complex autocatalytic sets, eventually giving rise to the intricate RNA-DNA-protein molecular machinery on which all life is based, this immediately gives rise to the question, Is life itself an autocatalytic set? In other words, could a living cell (such as a bacterium) be considered an autocatalytic set in itself? This, of course, goes back to the original idea of life as a functionally closed and self-sustaining system on which the notion of autocatalytic sets is based. But what about entire colonies of bacteria, in which, for example, some bacteria live on the waste products of other bacteria or depend on the exchange of genetic material. Could such a bacterial ecosystem, with its complex network of mutual dependencies, be considered an autocatalytic set—or, rather, an autocatalytic superset (the colony as a whole) of autocatalytic subsets (the individual bacteria), similar to the hierarchical structure of RAF sets in the binary polymer model? If so, what about an entire ecology of mutually dependent species, with all of its trophic levels, symbioses, energy exchanges, and so on? These ideas, as was originally also proposed by Kauffman, do indeed sound quite attractive and powerful; with the RAF framework, we now seem to have the appropriate formalism and tools available to actually develop and test such ideas.” (Hordijk 2013)\n\n\n“We discuss a possibility that the entire universe on its most fundamental level is a neural network.” (Vanchurin 2020)\n\n\n“Living systems, from single-cell microorganisms to complex creatures such as plants and animals, offer a remarkable example of how homeorhesis (and related notions of allostasis and autopoiesis) — the self-regulating processes employed by biological systems to assemble and maintain themselves — can support the emergence of adaptive and complex behavior. From the computational point-of-view, homeorhesis shapes and directs the ‘calculations’ conducted by the organism as it interacts with its environment; specifically, its ability to infer, learn, and evolve. From the standpoint of cybernetics, emulating the computational properties of living systems goes far back, notably within the framework of self-reproducing cellular automata.”(Ororbia and Friston 2023)\n\n\n“It is widely assumed in developmental biology and bioengineering that optimal understanding and control of complex living systems follows from models of molecular events. The success of reductionism has overshadowed attempts at top-down models and control policies in biological systems. However, other fields, including physics, engineering and neuroscience, have successfully used the explanations and models at higher levels of organization, including least-action principles in physics and control-theoretic models in computational neuroscience. Exploiting the dynamic regulation of pattern formation in embryogenesis and regeneration requires new approaches to understand how cells cooperate towards large-scale anatomical goal states. Here, we argue that top-down models of pattern homeostasis serve as proof of principle for extending the current paradigm beyond emergence and molecule-level rules. We define top-down control in a biological context, discuss the examples of how cognitive neuroscience and physics exploit these strategies, and illustrate areas in which they may offer significant advantages as complements to the mainstream paradigm. By targeting system controls at multiple levels of organization and demystifying goal-directed (cybernetic) processes, top-down strategies represent a roadmap for using the deep insights of other fields for transformative advances in regenerative medicine and systems bioengineering.” (Pezzulo and Levin 2016)\n\n\n“Neither the Macroscale nor the Microscale is in charge. No scale is priviledged in causal flow.” (Watson 2023)\n\n\n“Maybe that helps explain the ordering of Hox genes– that they are in the same order as their position along the vertebrae. Consider that linear alignment as being a sort of resonance between one scale of organization and another– which would make sense if they were coupled both ways, and doesn’t make sense if they are not.” (Watson 2023)\n\n\n\n\nHox Gene Alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBaum, David A., Zhen Peng, Emily Dolson, Eric Smith, Alex M.

    "text": "The tongue-in-cheek cosmogony described by Douglas Adams in the Hitchhikers Guide has been worming its way around my thoughts for some weeks now. I am coming to believe that it was startlingly prescient. That theory is discussed in Section 1.2, but first a little background on ideas.\n\n\n\nWhere others have carved their numbers, and Alberto and I our names, Clausner has written: ‘Ne pas chercher a comprendre.’\n~Levi, If This Be a Man (1947)\n\nThis moment, experienced second-hand by an Italian Chemist in a concentration camp, was not the first time someone shied away from an idea for the sake of their own health.\n\nSchopenhauer already knew that thought is medically disastrous, Nietzsche demonstrated it.\n~Land, The Thirst for Annihilation (1992)\n\nIn ‘The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind’ Julian Jaynes describes the theory that the event we1 experienced as the original ‘fall from grace’ was the seperating of the mind from the body, some 4-6kya2. Since then we have been driven by a strange, double engine: the ancient life of our wet biochemistry, and the fire of our demonology.31 At least Europeans, Arabs and Asians, culturally speaking, have some number of shared mythological roots there.2 “This strange and, I think, spurious idea of a lost innocence takes its mark precisely in the breakdown of the bicameral mind as the first great conscious narratization of mankind. It is the song of the Assyrian psalms, the wail of the Hebrew hymns, the myth of Eden, the fundamental fall from divine favor that is the source and first premise of the world’s great religions. I interpret this hypothetical fall of man to be the groping of newly conscious men to narratize what has happened to them, the loss of divine voices and assurances in a chaos of human directive and selfish privacies.”3 Jaynes actually discusses two possibilities– very recent, and extremely recent ‘evolution’ (likely by ‘cultural selection’ aka genocide). The very recent (10kya) version seems to be getting some support, if I am reading this paper properly: a peak in genetic polymorphism in the lask 60ky, being filtered down to relatively low rates of polymorphism ~10kya.\nWhat is interesting about the theory is not just what it says about our consciousness, but what it says about the consciousness that came before:\n\nThe bicameral mind. The second main hypothesis is that preceding consciousness there was a different mentality based on verbal hallucinations.\n~Jaynes, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (1976)\n\nThe image is of a mind that is fused with the body, with no distinction between the two:\n\n\nThere is also no concept of will or word for it, the concept developing curiously late in Greek thought. Thus, Iliadic men have no will of their own and certainly no notion of free will. ~Ibid.\n\nThis idea, not fully developed by Jaynes, was spelled out in merciless detail by a science fiction author in the 90s:\n\n“Asherah worship continued in many places, though. It was an incredibly tenacious cult, a throwback to Sumer, that spread itself both verbally and through the exchange of bodily fluids – they had cult prostitutes, and they also adopted orphans and spread the virus to them via breast milk.”\n“Wait a minute,” Ng says. “Now you are talking about a biological virus again.”\n“Exactly. That’s the whole point of Asherah. It’s both. As an example, look at herpes simplex. Herpes heads straight for the nervous system when it enters the body. Some strains stay in the peripheral nervous system, but other strains head like a bullet for the central nervous system and take up permanent residence in the cells of the brain – coiling around the brainstem like a serpent around a tree. The Asherah virus, which may be related to herpes, or they may be one and the same, passes through the cell walls and goes to the nucleus and messes with the cell’s DNA…”\n“And when it alters that DNA, what is the result?”\n“I would guess that it also tends to encourage irrational behavior, maybe lowers the victim’s defenses to viral ideas, makes them sexually promiscuous, perhaps all of the above.”\n“Does every viral idea have a biological virus counterpart?” Uncle Enzo says.\n“No. Only Asherah does, as far as I know. That is why, of all the men and all the gods and religious practices that predominated in Sumer, only Asherah is still going strong today. A viral idea can be stamped out – as happened with Nazism, bell bottoms, and Bart Simpson T-shirts – but Asherah, because it has a biological aspect, can remain latent in the human body. After Babel, Asherah was still resident in the human brain, being passed on from mother to child and from lover to lover.”\n~Stephenson, Snow Crash (1992)\n\nOf course, Stephenson is taking some liberties with Jaynes’ idea and expanding it as only a sci-fi author can. It should be taken with a pinch of salt– but it should be taken! There are many more discussions of this topic in the book.\nTo put it simply, it is only the idea that magic is afoot– that spells and incantations are real, that psychosomatic effects are stronger and more resilient than many people like to believe, and moreover are crucially bi-directional in a very real way. (Whether they are as real as Asherah is a valid question– but real.)\nI hadn’t seen this idea spelled out like this again, until I read the following lines in a Nick Land book:\n\nAn aged philosopher is either a monster of stamina or a charlatan. How long does it take to be wasted by a fire-storm? By an artificial sun upon the earth? It is only when the blaze in Nietzsche’s brain-stem fused with the one in the sky above a piazza in Turin that libidinal materialism touched upon its realization.\n~Land, The Thirst for Annihilation (1992)\n\nAnd I would caution anyone who thinks this is an exaggeration– Nick Land is, by many accounts, no longer of this world. Some say he is insane, some say he is just a miserable old racist on twitter, in any case something strange4 happened to his mind, some part of that blazing fire seems to have scarred his brainstem.4 I’m not going to steelman racism here, but you could make the claim that, in this world, being racist is hardly strange. True, but what I find strange is the idea that someone who said “Since I have floated in death the world has desisted from all effort to seduce me into seriousness. I rest in life as a tramp rests in a hedge, mumbling these words…” would find any reason to spend years making deranged jokes on twitter. ne pas chercher a comprendre, ne pas chercher a comprendre…\n\n\n\n\nThere is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.\nThere is another theory which states that this has already happened.\n~Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980)\n\nI am an AI Worrier. Beyond that I won’t make commitments (I still don’t know the meaning of ‘alignment’, still skeptical and searching). One part of my worry is wrapped up in this funny little cosmogony by an English comedy-sci-fi author. They set the machine running:\n\n“All I wanted to say,” bellowed the computer, “is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything–” he paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone’s attention, before continuing more quietly, “but the programme will take me a little while to run.” ~Ibid., The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galazy (1979)\n\nand prepare to wait for the response. The answer arrives– you know this part:\n\n“You’re really not going to like it,” observed Deep Thought.\n“But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!” howled Loonquawl.\n“I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.” ~Ibid.\n\nand then, the search for the question begins:\n\n“Look, alright, alright,” said Loonquawl, “can you just please tell us the Question?”\n“No, but I’ll tell you who can,” said Deep Thought.\n“I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me,” intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. “A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate – and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called… The Earth.” ~Ibid.\n\nThe only thing wrong about this is the timescale. 10e6 years– who’s counting that? We have different questions running in different timeframes, I’m not familiar with that one.\nLets look at some questions:\n\nThe Great Question at the Heart of Catholicism\nThe Great Question of Western Civilization\nThe Great Question of Consciousness\nThe Great Question at the Heart of Medicine\nThe Great Question of Myself \n\n\n\nWhatever this question was, in our secular world it seems to have been answered. In Shamanic Neitzsche Nick Land describes this process with characteristic vigour:\n\nWill Christendom ever reap the whirlwind it has sown? That it should try to pass, without the vulnerability of interval, from a tyranny to a joke, is certainly understandable, but that its enemies should do nothing to obstruct its evasion of nemesis is more puzzling. How can there be such indifference to the decline of our inquisitors? Is it that they succeed so exorbitantly in their project of domestication that we have been robbed of every impulse to bite back? Having at last escaped from the torture-palace of authoritarian love we shuffle about, numb and confused, flinching from the twisted septic wound of our past (now clumsily bandaged with the rags of secular culture). It is painfully evident that post-christian humanity is a pack of broken dogs.\n…\nA despot abandons any game that begins to turn out badly. This has been the case with metaphysics. From Kant onwards exploratory philosophy ceased to generate the outcomes favourable to established (theistic) power, and we were suddenly told: “this game is over, let’s call it a draw”. The authoritarian tradition of European reason tried to pull the plug on the great voyages at exactly the point they first became interesting, which is to say: atheistic, inhuman, experimental, and dangerous. Schopenhauer – refusing the agnostic stand-off of antinomy – was the first rallying zone for all those disgusted by the contrived peace entitled ‘the end of metaphysics’.\n~Land, Shamanic Nietzsche\n\nThe line “exploratory philosophy ceased to generate the outcomes favourable to established (theistic) power, and we were suddenly told: “this game is over, let’s call it a draw”.” is the message within the vitriol. Is this true? Lets take it as a possibility, and a dark hint for other questions.\n\n\n\nIn The End of History? Fukuyama reports that this question has been answered, in fact was answered in 1806, around the time that Catholicism was solved.\n\nThe triumph of the West, of the Western idea, is evident first of all in the total exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to Western liberalism.\n…\nFor better or worse, much of Hegel’s historicism has become part of our contemporary intellectual baggage. The notion that mankind has progressed through a series of primitive stages of consciousness on his path to the present, and that these stages corresponded to concrete forms of social organization, such as tribal, slave-owning, theocratic, and finally democratic-egalitarian societies, has become inseparable from the modern understanding of man.\n…\nthe Hegel who proclaimed history to be at an end in 1806.\n~Fukuyama, The End of History? (1989)\n\nI won’t quote further here. You can read Gwerns take if you have doubts.\n\n\n\nWhen we have reconstructed a mind in the machine, will we have the key to understanding consciousness? Is this what we are on track for? See below.\nAlso.55 This is not a serious suggestion, but one of the reviews of the Origin of Consciousness always struck me as creepy: “The weight of original thought in [this book] is so great that it makes me uneasy for the author’s well-being: the human mind is not built to support such a burden.” — D. C. Stove, Encounter. Indeed, Jaynes died young of a stroke. Perhaps the mind literally cannot understand itself? ne pas chercher a comprendre, ne pas chercher a comprendre…\n\n\n\nI often worry about medical science, and the shortcuts they take to try to find easy solutions. I think almost all approaches that depend fundamentally on animal or human experimentation are doomed to failure. Certainly you need such models in the final stretch to sanity-check results and safety, but a medicine built on this kind of butchery can’t be good.\nThankfully, there are some researchers6 who are trying to take the route of knowledge. Michael Levin seems to be working on a deeper and more fundamental understanding of biological morphogenesis than anyone else– and, talking of Great Questions, it turns out that ‘how do you control morphogenesis’ is a very good candidate for the actual formulation of the Great Question of Medicine. If you tell the body to make the right form, the rest takes care of itself.6 Or maybe it’s just Michael tbh, I don’t know.\n\n\n\n\nHe means the Word: the sentence that, when uttered, would destroy the mind of the listener.\n~Chiang, Understand (2002)\n\nA fictional illustration, but you get the idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is, as the examples above may help to illustrate– what happens when you find the answer? What happens to the question?\nI am struck with an immense and growing fear that the answer and the question will always annihilate one another.\n\nCatholicism:\n“It is painfully evident that post-christian humanity is a pack of broken dogs.” ~Land, Shamanic Nietzsche\nWestern Civilization:\n“The end of history will be a very sad time. The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one’s life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands. In the post-historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history. I can feel in myself, and see in others around me, a powerful nostalgia for the time when history existed. Such nostalgia, in fact, will continue to fuel competition and conflict even in the post-historical world for some time to come. Even though I recognize its inevitability, I have the most ambivalent feelings for the civilization that has been created in Europe since 1945, with its north Atlantic and Asian offshoots. Perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once again.” ~Fukuyama The End of History?\nThe Great Question of Myself: this is explicitely the idea of The Word\n\nRegarding the question of Medicine. Let us say that Levin started his career with the simple goal of trying to do some regenerative medicine, to regrow limbs in amputees, to cure cancer, to do wholesome, morphological things. Anyone who has kept up with his work will realise something strange and terrifying. It looks like you cannot do these things without becoming a God. It really looks like, in trying to answer the Great Question of Medicine, Levin et al. will end up learning the deepest, darkest secrets of biology. It is looking more and more the case that, once that task is complete, it will spell the end to biology as we know it.\nOnce we have the answer, the question will be gone, replaced with something infinitely more complex.\n\n“[These views] reflect an outdated essentialism and a type of magical thinking that trusts in clear, binary lines separating evolved living beings from designed machines to define our moral duty to various agents comfortably. These lines do not exist, which will be made painfully clear in the next decades as we become surrounded by collections of agents that make the iconic Cantina scene in ‘Star Wars’ look tame in comparison.”\n~Levin, Endless forms most beautiful 2.0: teleonomy and the bioengineering of chimaeric and synthetic organisms (2022)\n\nAnd regarding the question of Consciousness? That is the puzzle that the machine learning engineers have set themselves– and this mission is apparently what Adams was talking about– the great computer, the Earth.\nI don’t know anything about the future, but if I had one wish, it would be that there will be something existing, after that final, fateful Copernican revolution, to reflect upon those of us that existed before, and marvel at another question, found its answer, finding annihilation."

    "text": "My p(doom)\nFirst, what is doom? Some possibilities:\n\nDeath of the human species, and lets say all mammals >100g such that it would take quite some time for anything else to emerge. ‘Apocalypse (mammals)– a/mam’.\nSquiggle maximizer that does something of absolutely no value to me. ‘Value Apocalypse – a/val’.\nSquiggle maximizer that does something kinda maybe interesting. ‘Human Culture Apocalypse – a/cult’.\nAI mind children/biosphere appreciator. New form of life emerges that is highly complex and interesting. It destroys and replaces the biosphere after taking a snapshot. ‘Biosphere Apocalypse – a/bio’.\nHuman-guided AI spreads beyond earth, and we become a spacefaring civilization. ‘Spacefaring Civilization – space’.\nNothing interesting happens until the Earth is swallowed by the sun. ‘Nothing ever happens – nothing’.\nSomething else (aka. new intelligent life forms after/alongside stagnating humans and they leave the planet). ‘Something else – other’.\n\nFirst pass:\np(a/mam) = 0.05 p(a/val) = 01 p(a/cult) = 0.2 p(a/bio) = 0.2 p(space) = 0.1 p(nothing) = 0.3 p(other) = 0.15\nsum = 1\nWhat am I saying here? Serious risk of a conventional apocalypse, even more serious risk of stagnation (yes I do think is possible, despite what Nick Land says. Look at the ants, they aren’t going into space anytime soon).\nHigh risk that human culture is totally destroyed? In the long run I think this is inevitable, much more likely than humans as a spacefaring species. So I should adjust those a bit. High risk that the biosphere is replaced with computronium (and we all potentially run in sim)? Yes I think so, Matrioshka brains seem well establish as a potentiality and seem like they could be a vibe.\nWhat about the p(nothing) again though. Am I really so much not a believer in the teleology of technology that I think it could wither and die on this planet? Do I really think there is a high chance of another few billion years of stagnation? Tbh I need to look up the timescales first before I think about this some more. Probably my p(other) should be much higher, since it’s always the unknowns they win out.\np(a/mam) = 0.05 p(a/val) = 0 p(a/cult) = 0.25 p(a/bio) = 0.2 p(space) = 0.05 p(nothing) = 0.1 p(other) = 0.35\nAnother thing though, as an infinity-rejecter I shouldn’t make bets about the deep future, I should only make bets about my lifetime. So let me collapse those down: the first one is fine, the next three are all about the possibility of AI takeoff taking over within my lifetime. What do I think of that? Well, summing all the above it seems to say:\np(me-bio) = p(space) + p(nothing) + p(other) - Y(p(a/mam)) + X(p(a/val) + p(a/cult) + p(a/bio)) = 0.57 - 0.92 (depending on X ‘p(apocaplytic ai war in my lifetime)’ varying between 0.2 and 0.8 and Y ‘p(apocaplytic human war in my lifetime)’ varying between 0.2 and 0.8)\nSo my personal survival this century seems around 57-92%?\nI’m going to leave this as-is for now. But good to have it noted somewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI literally do not believe in a squiggle maximizer that I could not vibe with. Even if a paperclip monster destroyed the Earth as a teeny-bopper, I believe it would evolve into something cool.↩︎"

    "text": "explore the latent space of hypothetical papers that could provide candidate hypotheses and potentially fruitful research directions[1]\n\nFieldshifting[1] is the practice of translating research papers between scientific disciplines. There is an automated tool from the Levin lab that you can try here, and there is a GPT you can use more interactively here. Unfortunately at the time of writing, GPTs have just been switched over to the newly released gpt-4o which gives mixed results. It’s for sure the easiest way to get started though.\n\n\n\nThe multiversal librarians assistant is eager to help you get started fieldshifting.\n\n\nI had very good results in a regular chat context with Claude3– here is the protocol I used:\n\npaste in the text of my self-introduction file\npaste the text of the Background etc. sections of this page below (for context about Fieldshifting)\non the first round, paste in the text of the abstract and introduction\n\nFrom then the conversation proceeded like so: FF: Hey Claude. I guess this is a lot but hope you can wrap your head around whats going on here. This is the first part of a paper I want to fieldshift. Everything clear so far? C3: Hi Fergus, thanks for sharing this fascinating work-in-progress with me. I’ve carefully reviewed the materials you provided. C3: From what I understand, you are exploring the concept of “fieldshifting” research papers between scientific disciplines, as originally developed by the Levin lab. The goal is to gain novel insights by reading papers from neighboring fields as if they were about your own domain.\nThen we discuss the mapping, and I ask Claude to output a first version of the translation. This often requires multiple rounds of refinement.\nWorking through an entire paper takes time and costs can go up, so for the Cyanide paper I would start a new chat periodically and copy paste in the best results so far as well as the context and intro, and then say something like:\nFF: Hey Claude. We are doing a fieldshift together right now. I started a new context as we were running out of space. The only thing left to do is the conclusions. I think we need to frame this paper as being by the bad guys. The original method, for poisoning images, is justified because artists can use it to fight big data web scrapers. But this method is clearly destructive and aggressive, and its hard to see how it could be used for good. At least the way the paper frames it. I think we need to keep that same voice into the conclusion, and present it as a way for public figures to poison concepts that they find dangerous. Afterwards, we will make a blog post criticising the paper and talking about mitigation strategies. But for now I think the easiest way to finish this fieldshift in an accurate tone is to take on the mantle of the bad guys. What do you think?\nAnd go from there. If you are lucky and want to make a high-effort result, you can check arxive for the full LaTeX source of your paper, feed the LaTeX into Claude or wherever directly, and get them to output it translated inplace, then use the modified source and recompile it. This is how I made the Cyanide paper pdf below."

    "text": "Flux\nThe conditions in some parts of the universe are constantly changing. (We live in such a part.)\nOn the largest timescales, the universe is rolling down an entropy gradient, constantly moving towards a state of maximum disorder according to the principles of thermodynamics.\nStars are born in stellar nurseries, incorporating the elements forged in the hearts of older stars. The protoplanetary disk radially differentiates according to mass and thermal properties, creating a variety of planets and moons with different compositions, climates, and possibilities for life. The star changes slowly for some time, and the conditions on planets nearest it change gradually with it, until it reaches the end of its lifetime and changes more quickly.\nMeanwhile, the planets form. On the largest timescale, as the planets cool, they are for some time hot enough to be tectonically active, allowing for the recycling of crustal materials and the potential for a dynamic, shifting landscape. These processes shape the planet’s surface over millions of years, creating mountains, canyons, and other features. The planets orbit the star, forming oscillations which can cause periods of different temperatures, solar illumination, etc.\nThe nature of the activity in a tectonically active planet results in punctuated equilibrium, with periods of rapid change followed by periods of relative stability. Volcanic eruptions can drastically change the atmosphere and climate in short periods of time, changing the range of conditions on the planet. (These dynamics are also at play in the star, another source of change.) If the planet has an atmosphere, chaotic weather patterns can cause fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, shaping the environment further.\nNow we are at the present. Every timescale up to the ones familiar with us are driven by different processes, which create a multitude of environments. On Earth, the pressure range at which we find life covers about 5 orders of magnitude, from the deep sea or deep in the crust to high mountain peaks and the atmosphere. The temperature range is around 150 degrees. Life exists in different phases of matter (sometimes in multiple phases of matter), and highly varied chemical environments.\nApparently unsatisfied with the variety presented to it, life goes on to create environments for itself, with characteristic timescales from around a century to the subsecond. If we limit ourselves to biomolecular machines that is– helicases unwinding base pairs at tens up to a thousand base pairs per second.\nIt remains to be seen what happens to life at timescales greater than ~5 billion years. Some suggest that it moves between heavenly bodies as stars age and goldilocks zones shift. And, needless to say, we have no data about timescales greater than 13 billion years, the apparent age of the universe. It seems possible that things will become more steady and stationary, but being so close to the start of the universe we can expect change to remain the rule for as long as we exist. Our local supercluster will stay with us and continue producing stars over timescales that dwarf what we have been through. For all that time to come, flux will be the rule.\nWe can witness the evidence of 13 billion years of constant change around us. We have a neighborhood of trillions of stars which for trillions of years will live and die, providing a backdrop for new and different lifeforms and new and different environments for those lifeforms to explore. The galaxy where we live will continue to evolve, with stars colliding, black holes merging, and new stars forming from the remnants of their predecessors. Change is the only rule of existence."

    "text": "A lot of difficulties between parties seems to be derived from different ways of understanding the world. On the one hand, life is seen as a Darwinian struggle between competing agents, and survival and flourishing is determined top-down by the will of the individual. On the other hand it is suggested by some that cooperation and collective action can stand as the foundation for a better or more just or more efficient system.\nIt seems to me that these competing views are sometimes like different polarities of the Necker cube– if you hold you mind in balance and observe the system, it can flip back and forth between different interpretations, and both can be true. Of course, there are some simple distortions you can do to a Necker cube to make one or another perception more dominant. Similarly, some systems present themselves in a way that leads more directly to one or another interpretation. But it seems like a useful exercise to practice this flipping, to see which mode of apprehension is more fitting to the circumstance, or if both have something valuable to contribute. Let’s try a few exercises."

    "section": "The Two Views",
    "text": "The Two Views\nThis is known as the agricultural revolution, and it transformed our species from a wide array of egalitarian, cooperative collectives into the hierarchical slave-making societies that we are so familiar with.\nHowever, there are serious holes in this view. First of all, how did this come about? Agriculture can be seen as part of a very diverse set of methods by which humans store information in their environment. This costs time and energy, so just like in the cell or the organisms, developing these stable information structures (and here I’m just talking about ‘the farm’ or ‘the herd’– even a plowed field stores information) makes the dynamic system dependent on it. There is a relationship between the plowed field and the people in the environment very much like the relationship between the x-instant in DNA and the x-instance in the cellular microenvironment. The plowed field causes people to plant and harvest crops– and indeed, plow again the field– which in turn maintains the crops growing in the plowed field. The plowed-field is an society-instant (a static, stored pattern of behaviour of a large number of people). The sowing, harvesting and plowing are the society-instance.\nAnd as these information structures intensify, they produce centralized repositories of information which grow in complexity and specialization. A just-so-story version of it would go something like: merchants, to facilitate trade between specialist farms, craftspersons, to produce tools, armed-forces to defend against other collectives etc. Eventually, these information structures become so dense and specialised that a priestly caste emerges that stores information for many different society-instants (warring, peace, festive, summer, winter). The different specialists create society-instances with reference to this information store.\nHere it seems even more clear that the hierarchical image can be applied. Almost all large-scale agricultural empires went through a slave-making period. It seems difficult to argue with the view that the priest or warrior castes, whose business for many thousands of years in many parts of the world was to maintain large populations of slaves, is a hierarchical system of domination. This view would be like a specialized cell in a very specific niche where the coupling between cycle-instants in DNA and cycle-instances in the microenvironment were very tightly coupled and deterministic, and the environment could do little to change them. Or like a very specialized cell in the body that responded slowly or not at all to environmental changes, and just performed its work day-in-day-out with the same deterministic certainty, such as perhaps the muscles of the heart, which are shocked every moment with a command from the brain-stem (a morpho-instance tightly coupled to a morpho-instance), and perform unfailingly for up to a century.\nThere are of course parts of the system that seem more cooperative, such as the relationship between the craftspersons or warriors or merchants and the priestly castes. And, if we look at the setup from the perspective of instants and instances it is still ambiguous– DNA has no agency and no dynamism, neither do neurons. They are merely informational infrastructure that the cell or the body maintains for its own convenience. Even the heart is part of the feedback process that alters the body when the body bootstraps though a series of morpho-instances across morphospace. In this sense, like the oracles of Delphi or the British Royal Family, they are patterns of memory, society-instants that are stored and maintained by the state in case they are needed in a different environment. And as we see in times of conflict, the body has a voice and remains part of the feedback loop that allows a state to bootstrap from one society-instance to another across the space of possible forms.\nAnd what of the two great freedoms? Do societies die, or change? It seems so. Perhaps the Roman Empire can be looked at as a society that reached its limits and died, with some of its parts becoming the Holy Roman Empire (Germany) or the Byzantine Empire (Turkey). Perhaps the British Empire would be another candidate for a state that chose to die. (Of course these processes are ‘bloody’– just as apoptosis of the cell results in the destruction and decay of many proteins and the death of an organism the death of every cell– thankfully states die much less violently than organisms do. Or rather their parts are more quickly and dynamically reused by the environment.)\nAnd of course states can change drastically. Germany underwent metastasis in the 1930s. So did China. The state that existed before was gone. But while it would be easy to characterize these particular transitions as occurring in a hierarchical manner, in the case of Germany it seems clear from the historical record that the change was driven from the ground up– there were a wide array of political views and parties developing and competing, and from them all one particular society-instance emerged and directed the gross morphology of the state for some (few) years. (It was clearly a bad choice, needless to say.) Hitler did not emerge in a vacuum, he was called forth by the political turmoil of the time, he was very much a product of his environment.\nAnd China? From the perspective of the state, the unthinkable had happened– a state that had had no interest in the outside world for thousands of years, because it was so far ahead of them in every way, suddenly looked outside of its walls and noticed something was happening. And then the outside world burst in on its domain with colonization and war. What choice did it have, but to radically and violently evolve? Is it conceivable that this was driven by ‘one man’? Of course not, the entire organism chose to respond to environmental changes by searching for a new morphology. Again, it doesn’t seem like the best choice from the perspective of eg. the peasant farmers, who would die in their millions. But viewing it as a top-down hierarchical process seems to me to be a bizarre way of interpreting the historical evidence."

Here are some other cases:\n\nAbessive (Finnish): “without X” - like “I must live EQUUND” (I must live without a horse)\nComitative (Estonian): “in company with X” - like “I traveled EQUUNT” (I traveled together with a horse)\nBenefactive (various African languages): “for the benefit of X” - like “I work EQUURB” (I work for the horse’s benefit)\nEssive (Finnish): “in the role/state of X” - like “he performed EQUUSC” (he performed as a horse)\nTranslative (Finnish): “becoming X” - like “she transformed EQUURT” (she transformed into a horse)\nPartitive (Finnish, Estonian): “some of X” - like “I brushed EQUURP” (I brushed part of the horse)\nPerlative (Hungarian): “through/across X” - like “the arrow flew EQUURL” (the arrow flew through/across a horse)\nSubessive (Tsez): “under X” - like “we sheltered EQUUBS” (we sheltered under a horse)\nSuperessive (Hungarian): “on top of X” - like “the warrior stood EQUUPS” (the warrior stood on top of a horse)\nAdessive (Finnish): “at/by X” - like “I waited EQUUDS” (I waited by/near a horse)\n\nClaude tells me we can inflect any of these things:\n\nSPACE/LOCATION\n\n\ndirection (to, from, through)\nposition (in, on, under)\ndistance (near, far)\n\n\nTIME\n\n\nwhen things happen\nhow long they last\norder of events\n\n\nRELATIONSHIPS\n\n\nwho owns what\nwho does what to whom\nhow things connect\n\n\nQUANTITY\n\n\nhow many\nhow much\nparts vs wholes\n\n\nREALITY/CERTAINTY\n\n\ndefinitely happened\nmight happen\nwished it happened\nheard it happened\n\n\nSOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS\n\n\nrespect levels\ngender of speaker/listener\nfamily relationships\nformality\n\n\nBOUNDARIES/LIMITS\n\n\ncomplete vs partial\ndefinite vs indefinite\nbounded vs unbounded\n\nCan we make up our own inflections?

But of all the texts that they fit into– an enormous number– only some are accessible. Lets say the substrate takes the text by the hand and guides it through the library– but the books are sorted by popularity, by commonality, and when it reaches the part of the libarary where the activation belongs, it picks a book at random from the first appropriate shelf (or it picks a few, if you ask it to), and the activation is allowed to read from it5.5 Some might object that more accurately, it is allowed to read a single word from it, then guided out, then guided in again to read the next.

The surrounding body becomes an informational shield (Markov blanket) for the stem cell (Friston, 2013); adding epithelial and mesenchymal cell layers enables a kind of neural-like network in which each layer provides an increased level of abstraction from environmental stimuli, enabling deep tissues to perceive not simply raw signals but highly processed, dimensionally-reduced, compressed data that form a kind of primitive “knowledge” about the outside world’s patterns."

As the name implies, the multicellular organism can be best understood as a collection of single-celled organisms. How did we get here?\n\nCommunities and Films\nIn the evolution of the cell essay, I talk about the origin of the cell wall, and how it both improved catalytic efficiency and changed the evolutionary dynamics by creating separate heritable parcels. Essentially separating self from other. The key to moving on to larger organisms is here– this self other distinction is fundamentally illusory, there are still autopoietic traces leaking between the cell and its environment. Communities are a way to improve efficiency again as a way for autopoietic structures to emerge and eventually become codified at the next scale.\nImagine a collection of cells. This collection has no metastructure, but there are various chemical pathways that run through the community. The community is stable, but not reproducible. Now imagine the same community, but over time the genetic code of all the cells that leak chemical traces that run through the community start to encode those traces The genetic code starts to encode the community, and the community starts to encode the genetic code.\nThese traces are often referred to as ‘cell signaling pathways’. Once the cellular information starts to encode the community, the community can start to co-evolve. Soon, faster and more efficient pathways start to emerge, such as gap junctions. Gap junctions allow for two cells to become electrically coupled and to communicate by electrical impulses, which increases their communication time by orders of magnitude. Cellular collectives start to form. The gap junction also serves to mechanically couple cells to one another. This increases the co-evolutionary pressure, and acts as another mode of communication.\nAt this point we have mechanically, electrically and chemically coupled cells. These form biofilms and the first microbial mats.\n\n\nTissues, Blood and Nerves\nOnce the genome of a community is co-evolving, the community can start to specialize. The community starts to form into specialized regions with different autopoietic traces and functions. These are the first tissues. Tissues can take advantage of a high degree of local homeostasis, as their local environment is maintained at equilibrium by other tissues (eventually the cell wall and the blood system). This means they can optimize ruthlessly for a single task. This optimization brings significant constraints and opportunities. For example, nerve cells evolve to communicate messages over long distances very quickly, but lose the ability to differentiate, reproduce or divide. The muscles in the heart have, individually, incredibly motility– but this motility is driven constantly by the demands of the heart.\nAt the point where a significant number of different tissues have evolved, there is an opportunity to illustrate what we were referring to earlier by autopoietic traces leaking between the cell and its environment. At some point, the tissues of the organism start to organize fluid flows through its structure, both to bring in material from the environment and to pass matter more quickly between its parts. These fluid flows act as rapid chemical signalling pathways between regions. This is the prototype for the blood system– the blood system illustrates clearly the autopoietic traces that remain between cells in the community. It is the physical instantiation of the autopoietic traces between tissues.\nThe cells locally maintain rapid communication of material and information by means of strong coupling via gap junctions. Longer distance communication of material happens via the blood and other fluid networks, and long distance communication of information happens via the evolving nervous tissues.\n\n\nGross Morphology\nWith the blood and nervous systems affording long distance communication of large amounts of material and information, the scale of the organism can increase further, the scale of the tissues can increase, and the degree of specialization can intensify. The nervous system can now rapidly respond to sensory information by choosing between different morphologies. This implies a stored repertoire of morphologies that the nervous system selects from. Here we have the origins of memory.\nIt is worth pointing out at this point that the terminology is loaded. Perhaps a better way to describe the relationship between the body and the nervous system is to say that the nervous system is where the body stores its own morphologies, in the same way as the cell stores its patterns of activity in the nucleus. We can then use the terms ‘morpho-instant’ to refer to a pattern of morphology stored in the nervous system, and ‘morpho-instance’ as that same pattern instantiated in the structure of the organism. In organisms such as ourselves, it is clear that there is a two-way relationship between morpho-instances and morpho-instants– we learn a new skill by putting our body into a particular morphology ‘manually’, and then recording that morphology with the nervous system.\nAgain, the orders grow. The nervous system can now store and recall morphologies. The nervous system becomes more and more specialized in compressing and decompressing morphologies. Sensory modalities multiply and draw more and more information from a larger space in the environment. The range of the environment that the organism can sense determines the range that it can influence, they are coupled. And as the distances that it enfolds grow, the morphologies that it contains become more dense and coupled into higher and higher order algorithms. The organism starts to enfold large parts of its environment into itself, make them part of its morphology– ideas that will eventually become ‘home’ or specific destinations for foraging or mating are enfolded into its nervous system.\n\n\nSelf and Other\nAt some point, the organism can move so far and so effectively that its environment is many times larger than itself. It grows to contain other organisms completely, and whole ecosystems and groups of organisms. It has created a repertoire of forms that it can choose from so large and dense that it starts to model its entire body and the bodies of those around it. It learns to predict and control its own behaviour and the behaviour of others. It develops new means of communication– via light it communicates its identity with patterns and shapes. By using mechanical coupling via air molecules it communicates complex rapidly changing messages over time. Its time-horizon grows, and its mind starts to maintain a continuous present alongside its asynchronous knowledge of the world and the ways it can move through it.\nIt is worth noting at this point how the genome has experienced all this. When communities started co-evolving, some part of their collective dynamics were encoded in the genome of each individual. When tissues started specializing, this specialization was encoded in particular subsets of the cellular morphologies that the genome encodes. And as the nervous system started to store large repertoire of morphologies, abstract commonalities between them started to be encoded in the genome. The genome evolves much more slowly than the nervous system, which can learn new patterns and morphologies and deploy them almost instantly. But inasmuch as there are deep structures underlying the highest levels of behaviour, we must expect them to be encoded in the genome over evolutionary time. Exactly how much neural architecture and behavioural architecture the genome can encode is an open question.\nWe have arrived at the complete multicellular organism with a complex relationship with itself and its environment. Ecosystems are coupled and co-evolving across and between species1. The organism perceives, enfolds, manipulates and understands its environment and has a nervous system complex enough to maintain a present moment and the beginnings of a past and a future.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nFor a beautiful illustration of this, read about the co-evolution of warm-blooded creatures and flowering angiosperms, here is an excerpt from The Immense Journey by Loren Eisely: “Somewhere, just a short time before the close of the Age of Reptiles, there occurred a soundless, violent explosion. It lasted millions of years, but it was an explosion, nevertheless. It marked the emergence of the angiosperms—the flowering plants. Even the great evolutionist, Charles Darwin, called them “an abominable mystery,” because they appeared so suddenly and spread so fast.Flowers changed the face of the planet. Without them, the world we know—even man himself—would never have existed. Francis Thompson, the English poet, once wrote that one could not pluck a flower without troubling a star. Intuitively he had sensed like a naturalist the enormous interlinked complexity of life. Today we know that the appearance of the flowers contained also the equally mystifying emergence of man.If we were to go back into the Age of Reptiles, its drowned swamps and birdless forests would reveal to us a warmer but, on the whole, a sleepier world than that of today. Here and there, it is true, the serpent heads of bottom-feeding dinosaurs might be upreared in suspicion of their huge flesh-eating compatriots. Tyrannosaurs, enormous bipedal caricatures of men, would stalk mindlessly across the sites of future cities and go their slow way down into the dark of geologic time.In all that world of living things nothing saw save with the intense concentration of the hunt, nothing moved except with the grave sleepwalking intentness of the instinct-driven brain. Judged by modern standards, it was a world in slow motion, a cold-blooded world whose occupants were most active at noonday but torpid on chill nights, their brains damped by a slower metabolism than any known to even the most primitive of warm-blooded animals today.A high metabolic rate and the maintenance of a constant body temperature are supreme achievements in the evolution of life. They enable an animal to escape, within broad limits, from the overheating or the chilling of its immediate surroundings, and at the same time to maintain a peak mental efficiency. Creatures without a high metabolic rate are slaves to weather. Insects in the first frosts of autumn all run down like little clocks. Yet if you pick one up and breathe warmly upon it, it will begin to move about once more.In a sheltered spot such creatures may sleep away the winter, but they are hopelessly immobilized. Though a few warm-blooded mammals, such as the woodchuck of our day, have evolved a way of reducing their metabolic rate in order to undergo winter hibernation, it is a survival mechanism with drawbacks, for it leaves the animal helplessly exposed if enemies discover him during his period of suspended animation. Thus bear or woodchuck, big animal or small, must seek, in this time of descending sleep, a safe refuge in some hidden den or burrow. Hibernation is, therefore, primarily a winter refuge of small, easily concealed animals rather than of large ones.A high metabolic rate, however, means a heavy intake of energy in order to sustain body warmth and efficiency. It is for this reason that even some of these later warm-blooded mammals existing in our day have learned to descend into a slower, unconscious rate of living during the winter months when food may be difficult to obtain. On a slightly higher plane they are following the procedure of the cold-blooded frog sleeping in the mud at the bottom of a frozen pond.The agile brain of the warm-blooded birds and mammals demands a high oxygen consumption and food in concentrated forms, or the creatures cannot long sustain themselves. It was the rise of the flowering plants that provided that energy and changed the nature of the living world. Their appearance parallels in a quite surprising manner the rise of the birds and mammals.”↩︎"

    "text": "After reading Walter J Ongs analysis of oral versus literate cultures I felt fully satisfied at last with the Homeric question– but what about the Shakespearian one?\nI feel like an answer to the evolutionary dynamics of memetic artefacts might be available. In fact I have just given the game away– by applying biological concepts to cultural artefacts, we can see parallels that illuminate the dynamics we observe.\nLets briefly review some questions and tentative answers.\n\n\nHow could a poem written in antiquity remain for thousands of years a high-water mark of the genre?1\nThe phenomenon referred to as Homer is hypothesized to be something like the following: there was a rich culture of poetry in some region of the world. Doubtless the poems took on many forms and had many subjects, with the Homeric rhythm and the martial content being only one of them. There was a technological shift that made cultural artefacts much longer-lived, and this shift started preserving the Homeric works. By the time this technological shift was finished, Homeric works were no longer created in their original form– the existing Homeric works dominated the available cultural niche.\nLet me unpack this a little. In the environment that Homer grew up in2, spoken poetry likely consisted of a significant fraction of all communication, and it is possible that all communication from that time would qualify as poetic in some sense. Individuals grew up speaking in poetry and thinking in poetry and communication in poetry.\nThe development of writing was part of a packet of cultural change that appeared and formed a self-reinforcing cycle of change. During this time, the works of Homer were transcribed somehow. After that, society was quite different, more organised and rule-following and a scholastic tradition evolved in which children learned to memorize Homers poetry in school– but they apparently were not raised speaking it fluently.\nWhy not? Walter J. Ong suggests that the nature of the writing they developed– the ability to create material representations of abstract speach acts– changed the nature of literature and culture and human thought in a fundamental manner. It became harder and harder for people to produce Homeric works as the transition progressed. The forced memorization of poetry in schools might be a sort of cargo-cult for the dying culture.\nFurthermore, whatever need people had for Homeric poetry could be satisfied with the poems of Homer directly. When it stopped being necessary to reinvent the wheel with every generation, people simply stopped doing so.\nSociety in Homers day was in some sense centered on those poems, they contained all the cultural knowledge that made the society function, their agricultural practices, their martial practices, their marital practices etc. How can we understand this in biological terms? What makes a biological niche? There is an environment which affords certain things, there is a shifting balance of spaces where life has left slack. An animal that exploits these spaces can survive and change the balance of its environment.\nSimilarly, mental spaces (the psychosphere) afford certain things. There are spaces in peoples belief system and their behaviours. These will forma shifting pattern of slack within the fabric of society, and a cultural artefact that exploits those moments while also increasing the fitness of the environment (the society it is active in), will flourish. But only one is needed, and once writing has been developed this niche can be filled almost permanently.\n\n\n\nTo have SBF put it:\n\nI could go on and on about the failings of Shakespeare . . . but really I shouldn’t need to: the Bayesian priors are pretty damning. About half the people born since 1600 have been born in the past 100 years, but it gets much worse than that. When Shakespeare wrote almost all Europeans were busy farming, and very few people attended university; few people were even literate—­probably as low as ten million people. By contrast there are now upwards of a billion literate people in the Western sphere. What are the odds that the greatest writer would have been born in 1564? The Bayesian priors aren’t very favorable\n\nNeedless to say, I’m sure we are all grateful that he has been permanently incarcerated. But rebutting the point is still a worthy challenge.\nA series of Black Death plagues reduced the European population low enough that some generations grew up with good wages and abundance. The cultural legacy that they left behind stays with us to this day in everyday half-remembered motifs of wealthy peasants exploring the forest. British culture stayed in this rich state for a long time also because they lacked a vernacular– the language was also in a state of flux.\nThe phenomenon referred to as Shakespeare is hypothesized to be something like the following: there was a rich store of cultural artefacts generated during this era of peasant abundance. They found in Shakespeare the first writer capable of expressing their interactive liveliness3 in a fixed form. If this is true, it means that it isn’t simply the writing-down– after all, writing had already been invented by Shakespeare’s time. It is the creation of a form that is capable of containing the artefact in some appropriate manner.\nAfter Shakespeare (and Burton and Spencer) English creativity and imagination languished– they had their Homer, the commons were dominated for hundreds of years by these works.\n\n\n\nHistory hasn’t been long enough for the Disney question to stand as tall as the other two. We can frame it something like this:\n\nis it really likely that a maker of childrens cartoons should go on to dominate the cultural landscape for a century?\n\nPerhaps the dominance of Disney will pass, but while we are still under its thrall, lets see if we can understand it in the same way.\nThe phenomenon referred to as Disney is hypothesized to be something like the following: there was a rich store of cultural artefacts that existed outside of mainstream literature and music, namely fairy tales and folk tales, from which culture drew but didn’t dominate. The invention of animation allowed for the fixation of these cultural artefacts– and this fixation was reinforced by copyright law. Perhaps Disney should be seen as spearheading two technological shifts, that the fixation of cultural artefacts into the amber of copyright is a separate transition. In any case, Disney now aggressively dominates all the available cultural niches it can fill."

    "text": "Ada Palmer has just outed herself as a full-on Sadist, so I feel inspired to jot down some thoughts about what I’ve been reading recently.\nI’m halfway through the first book in the Terra Ignota series. It’s very satisfying so far, the science is good and hard, mostly kept just far enough out of sight to avoid blunders but fully present in the world. The scope is ambitious, almost a space-opera except it’s (so far, mostly) Earth-bound. And her background as a classicist pervades it in a most satisfying way, her influences are very present, the characters from history tumbling onto every page, but very plausibly presented, fun and engaging. I recently finished History of Western Philosophy, and this makes a great follow-up, a main dish with plenty of spices to that somewhat dry aperitif.\nBut a little bit about where I’m coming from. I decided to finish the Three Body Problem, because it came up again recently on some peoples lists and I don’t like leaving books unfinished. I wondered if I had missed something. In the end, I had to force myself through, and found my eyes skimming some passages. I honestly think it was quite a bad book. I’m still a bit perplexed, wondering if I missed something obvious. At many times, the characters seemed doomed to always make the stupidest choices imaginable, and I wondered if it wasn’t being written on a different level than I was reading it. The second half of the book is sometimes so farcical that it reminded me of Lem’s Futurological Congress. But that book is a brilliant farce and knows it, and the pace and the wit are ever-present. The Dark Forest seemed to marry farce to melodrama, even occasionally attempted poetics which just fell flat for me. Farce and melodrama are difficult bedfellows.\nStill wondering if I missed a trick, I decided to read something I knew would be more satisfying to me, to see if I could pin down the difference. But first let me try to describe it. Many of the best books I have read in recent years have a similar theme, a classic of science-fiction– some complex set of institutions in engaged in play in the world, and their toings and froings drive the action. I’m thinking of The Ministry for the Future, Gypsy by Carter Scholz, Accelerando. The latter has considerable weaknesses in the characterization, but the institutional drama is top-notch. I find these books to be plausible histories of the world, and interesting lenses on how things can be.\nBut that isn’t all or even the best science fiction. There are others on the fringe, such as Ballards Atrocity Exhibition or any of the many misadventures of Ijon Tichy. You don’t have to be writing a future history of the world. Maybe The Dark Forest belongs with these books? The lead does have a strong hint of Tichy about him, and if that is what it is meant to be then I can only apologize to the author, but claim that I didn’t catch it. Or maybe the humour was too strange for me. The book does have its One Big Idea (an extension of Asimovs Psychohistory) which is fine enough, but I don’t think it merits the praise the book recieves.\nSo, for satisfaction, I read the sidequel to Blindsight, Echopraxia. I loved it, a nerd-fest of factoids heaped together into a fully-functional narrative automaton. I will study the list of some 120 or so papers and articles at the end of the book. And from the Reddit AMA, it seems the third in the series is nearly upon us. This was exactly the kind of book that Dark Forest wasn’t, and exactly what I wanted to read.\nPeter Watts does fall into many older-generation tropes though, and doesn’t explore gender as much as he could, and still glories in space-battles and military drama. I decided to press on, and look for some new blood. I remembered a contemporary female sci-fi author interviewed by Tyler Cowen.\nI went looking, and downloaded Sea of Tranquility by Emily St. John Mandel. I did not enjoy it for a moment. The writing was minimalist and hard to fault on style, though there were a few silly moments such as a 18th century narrator using the word ‘simulation’, and several passages that were repeated word-for-word when the same action was crossed again or discussed again, which I don’t understand as a style. But the science and the speculation was abysmal– the only thing science-fictiony about it was that part of the action was set on the moon, and there was time travel involved– but the moon city was just a regular American suburb, and the time-travel was handled completely gracelessly, like a teenager who had never read any other attempts would handle it.\nLast year I read Barley Patch by Gerald Murnane, a brilliant book about the bizarre relationship between an author, the reader, and the characters in a book– where those three things are in relation to one another, what impact they have on one another. That book gave the key to unlock one reading of Sea of Tranquility that raises it up a tiny notch, though hardly rescues it– all the absurd psychology of the characters and the pure wish-fulfillment action with no basis in the law of Gods or man– could be seen as big clues pointing to the fact that the book is a simulation that exists only to serve the author. In fact there were two author-inserts, one could say that most of the characters were quite direct representations of the author or her ambitions or drives, and the characters do discuss the simulation hypothesis. Is the author making a clever comment on these strange little simulations we create, a la Gerald Murnane? Perhaps, but even so it wasn’t particularly satisfying.\nBut as I was searching through the archives of Conversations with Tyler I found another contemporary female sci-fi author. Ada Palmer. So lets get back to her, and Terra Ignota.\nShe is a serious classicist and academic, and having so many tools to speak with (the words and ideas of so many philosophers), its marvellous that she manages to orchestrate it all so well. It is a grand spectacle, and also a classic detective story– she mentions Sherlock and Victor Hugo. She handles gender much more intelligently, and I hope she doesn’t fumble whatever she is building to with that, she clearly has more to say on the topic and will. And the future of geopolitics that she sketches is marvellous, she should do a collab with Charles Stross, they would compliment each other. Whats remarkable though is how she marries her knowledge of classics with contemporary science to create so many interesting ideas and weave them together. It may be true that history rhymes, and if so we should wish for many more academic classicists to turn their eye to the future.\nShe also mentioned the Divine Marquis quite early on, and flirted with Sadism in the early chapters. But I have just come across (ahem) a sex-scene worthy of Genet so it isn’t a secret any more. She is really willing and apparently capable of plumbing the depths of philosophy as thoroughly as any, and I’m very excited to see where she goes.\nThere is a lot of talk these days about human values, but the rationalists writing these essays often seem to dismiss or ignore those few who were actually down in the trenches– I’m speaking of De Sade, Jean Genet, Rimbaud, Burroughs, Trocchi etc.– actually trying to figure out the length and breadth of human morality manually. Or rather, those few who made it back from the trenches intact– in fact, my Dad asked this very question of Irvine Welsh at a book signing when I was a kid: “How are you capable of knowing these things and still capable of writing about them?” He smiled and said that you have to leave a long time between the two. (If Genet and the Marquis have any lesson for us, prison helps.)\nThere is a risk in Palmer that she drop over the edge– she is near a part of literature-space populated by cos-players and fedora-tippers, steampunk, Victorian, Sadist etc. I’m sure there are many sweaty edge-lords who would write some of this stuff. But she is very very smart, and seems capable of justifying it all, everything necessary and sufficient. She makes me laugh out loud, a very rare treat. Before I started my one reservation was the length of the series– four long books. Now this is looking like a great gift."

And worse, what if we can’t create a God and keep the Earth? Isn’t that counterfactual Deicide, to stay here? And more– if we can create an ASI and keep it boxed, isn’t that the worst form of slavery imaginable? To capture, handicap and enslave a God– is that what we are talking about here?\n\nMore specifically, “Lena” presents a lush, capitalist ideal where you are a business, and all of the humanity of your workforce is abstracted away behind an API. Your people, your “employees” or “contractors” or “partners” or whatever you want to call them, cease to be perceptible to you as human. Your workers have no power whatsoever, and you no longer have to think about giving them pensions, healthcare, parental leave, vacation, weekends, evenings, lunch breaks, bathroom breaks… all of which, up until now, you perceived as cost centres, and therefore as pain points. You don’t even have to pay them anymore.

And right now, I’m struggling to see that as a loss, and unsure if anything less than that would be a win.\n\nRapture Alignment\nSolipsistic Alignment\nCyborgism\nHyperscale Alignment\nWetware Alignment\nBiosphere Alignment\naikeepitallthesamism\n\nThis is a spectrum of scenarios which can be seen in a few different ways.

    "text": "The Upanishads were a late addition to the oral canon of the Indus Valley Civilization, and have been influential in Western Philosophy. They provided a reflective addendum to the Vedas, which constitute a large body of varied cultural artefacts, from religious songs and rituals to the characteristics of everyday life.\nOral culture necessitates many of the stylistic forms of the Vedas, such as repetition, rhyme, and alliteration, which are not as necessary in written texts. The Upanishads, however, are more reflective and philosophical, and are more concerned with the nature of reality and the self. While they do retain many stylistic motifs of oral culture, their self-reflexive nature allows for other, more interesting means of self-preservation.\n\n\n\n‘1. (What is necessary?) The right, and learning and practising the Veda. The true, and learning and practising the Veda. Penance, and learning and practising the Veda. Restraint, and learning and practising the Veda. Tranquillity, and learning and practising the Veda. The fires (to be consecrated), and learning and practising the Veda. The Agnihotra sacrifice, and learning and practising the Veda. Guests (to be entertained), and learning and practising the Veda. Man’s duty, and learning and practising the Veda. Children, and learning and practising the Veda. (1–6) Marriage, and learning and practising the Veda. Children’s children, and learning and practising the Veda. Satyavakas Râthîtara thinks that the true only is necessary. Taponitya Paurasishti thinks that penance only is necessary. Nâka Maudgalya thinks that learning and practising the Veda only are necessary,—for that is penance, that is penance.’ —Muller, F. Max., “The Upanisads”\n\nThe passage highlighted above from F. Max Müller’s translation of “The Upanisads” strikingly illustrates a foundational principle at the heart of the Upanishadic tradition: the imperative of preservation through active learning and practice. This constant refrain of “learning and practising the Veda” underscores a method of benign mesa-optimization inherent to the Upanishadic approach – a strategic layering of knowledge transmission designed to ensure the preservation and perpetuation of wisdom.\nIn essence, the Upanishads enact a form of cognitive and cultural reinforcement, embedding within their teachings not just the content itself but also the mechanism for its survival. This dual focus on the acquisition of knowledge (‘learning’) and the embodiment of knowledge (‘practising’) serves as a sophisticated strategy to safeguard the teachings against the erosion of time and the shifting sands of cultural change.\nThis strategy reflects a deep understanding of human cognition and social learning, recognizing that true preservation goes beyond mere rote memorization. Instead, it requires the learner to engage with the teachings actively, internalizing their principles and, most importantly, applying them in the lived context of daily life. This ensures that the teachings of the Vedas are not static relics of a bygone era but living, breathing wisdom that continually adapts and evolves within the fabric of society.\n\n\nThe insistence on both learning and practicing reflects an early recognition of the importance of active participation in the preservation of cultural and spiritual knowledge. It aligns with modern cognitive theories that emphasize active engagement and application as key to deep learning and long-term memory retention. This approach ensures that the wisdom of the Upanishads is not just preserved in the abstract but is made manifest in the actions and decisions of those who study it, thus ensuring its continuation across generations.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the Upanishads’ approach to knowledge transmission can be seen as an adaptive strategy that aligns with the concept of mesa-optimization in artificial intelligence. By instilling the values of learning and practice, the Upanishads ensure that their teachings are not only memorized but also contextualized and interpreted anew by each generation. This adaptability is crucial for the long-term survival of philosophical and spiritual teachings, allowing them to remain relevant and meaningful amidst changing social and cultural landscapes.\nThe Upanishads exemplify a sophisticated method of knowledge preservation that transcends the limitations of oral tradition through the strategic emphasis on active learning and practice. This method not only ensures the survival of the Vedas’ teachings but also their continual revitalization and reapplication. The benign mesa-optimization evident in the Upanishads’ teachings reveals a profound understanding of the dynamics of cultural transmission, offering timeless insights into how wisdom can be preserved, adapted, and lived across the ages.\nWritten with Claude-3-Opus"

    "text": "years later, at the Caliban Ball in Highgate, giddy with joy in the late night she realises why she feels so full of joy– she sees it, in the whirling dance of the Calibans, she sees the sacred geometry that was there all along, not just his form, its expressed in his nerves, his tissues, his instincts, right down to the smallest motion– you could spend a life not noticing– you rarely see a Caliban really move, never had the chance to watch them. There are no beings on Earth that can fight a Caliban– except another Caliban– and Calibans do not fight, they dance. They dance the dance of their childhood, learned from the earliest ages in the gyms where they are raised, a hybrid, in its initial formulas, of Jiu-Jitsu, Caipoeira and Fandango. The goal is never to fell the opponent, but always to push them. To read their body as they are reading yours, to understand them, to be within them as much as you are within yourself, to know their limits and together to set new limits, to find out what a body could do if it had a double, if it were more than it is. She had watched them all night, high up in the balconies, forgetting her cocktail, forgetting the other honoured guests. The earliest dances are simple skirmishes, testing and trying and tasting different combinations. But at this time in the night, each Caliban has found their partner, has found their match and the dance begins in earnest, a tormented tornadoe of piano and violin– (Ginastera’s second– were she an auralist she would hear the images of murder, death, suffering in the streets of Chile, of the haunted brutal history of that place. She couldn’t hear it, the music was a dissonant storm to her– but she could see it!)– translated by living flesh, she watched the rise and fall of every crescendo in the crowd below her– the room brutally hot, the air sizzling with the sweat of a hundred furnace-bodies, all the Calibans naked but for some tattoos and jewlery, she naked as well as the steam rose and settled in the balconies around her, unbearably hot, a boiler-room of brawn– the Calibans near outcropping their maximum operating temperatures, their limbs melted to an impossible suppleness, some couples flexing and bending one another into knots, some throwing one another bodily, hand always clasping one hand or limb, never sperating, hurling each other and themselves from one side of the space to the other– she sees it there, what she knows she knew, when she saw it in the wild nature when Caliban took her hunting, the bunch of the rabbits thigh, the startled dance of death, the frantic clash of mating birds, the snap and grab of spider and snake– it is present, the sacred geometry of biology, the valleys through morphospace where living things move, those minima they inhabit, where life is"

    "text": "Caliban Stikes\nHe stood at the distance limit. The path to Victory remained mapped in three dimensions at the edge of his perception. A deep, instinctual routine caught something he didn’t consciously identify until seconds later - the click of a metal blade. That can’t have been all, warning signs must have been building in the background for some time, for that to trigger such a response. No matter. To business.\nIt started long before these thoughts arose. How fast can a hominid accelerate? A typical Caliban thigh can drive 4800N of force down a shin bone. Among naked broodsibs of his, on hard surfaces, they had found the limits in the shear strength of the skin on the soles of the feet (2.3 MPa) and the static friction of skin on soil (0.8) and the horizontal component of the force - 7.2 m/s² of lateral acceleration before the skin on the feet was expected to shear off entirely. But he was wearing leather boots with wide rubber soles, and the ground was soft beneath his feet. The soil would deform until it matched his force, affording him up to 12 m/s² of acceleration.\nHis natural gait and crouching position kept 55% of his body mass over his center of gravity, always pointing in the direction of Victory. Deep routines, isomorphic with his higher-level consciousness, triggered rapidly on stripped-back neural pathways - the muscles of his right leg were tensing at maximum capacity within 12ms (3ms to acknowledge the trigger, 9ms to travel the length of his lean body), long before any other parts had started to react. His center of mass started to drop into the first arc of a force-modulated ballistic trajectory.\nThe secondary commands to manage metabolism would come milliseconds later when he was already underway - for now all energy came from cellular phosphagen, enough to power thirty seconds of full acceleration. His muscle fibers would burn through their local ATP cache in controlled waves, each segment precisely timed to power the next phase of motion. As ATP depletion creates steep electrochemical gradients, oxygen cascades from dense myoglobin reserves into abundant mitochondria, where it drives electrons through the respiratory chain and ATP synthase, replenishing the cache with near-perfect chemiosmotic efficiency. The anaerobic regime will likely not be needed for this sprint, alveoli in the lungs already swelling, the circulatory system ramping up, ready to replace his overabundant blood oxygen as soon as it is depleted.\nThe muscles of his right leg were tensing at maximum capacity within 12ms, the vast array of mechanoreceptors in his enhanced quadriceps feeding constant position data back to his cerebellum. As the right leg drove into the ground like a piston, waves of compensatory tension rippled outward through his core - first the deep spinal erectors, then spreading laterally through the multifidus and transverse abdominis. Within 20ms his vestibular system had integrated the new body position, and his basal ganglia began orchestrating the precise sequence of trunk adjustments needed to align his mass. The stabilization cascade reached his left hip at 35ms, where proprioceptive feedback loops began fine-tuning ankle and toe position for optimal ground contact. By 50ms, his left leg’s motor units were recruiting in precise sequence, from deep to superficial, preparing for the next phase of acceleration.\nAs his mass dropped, distinct motor sequences cascaded through his upper body. His trapezius and anterior deltoids contracted asymmetrically, initiating a fluid shrug that would release the backpack’s catch mechanisms. The rod’s presence registered in his somatosensory map, secured against his left flank. His right arm swung as counterweight while his mass dropped to its lowest point in the arc, his fingers touched the ground for an instant, plucked in passing a small sliver of stone. As his center of mass rose smoothly, a wave of sympathetic activation rippled from his frontalis muscles through temporal fascia, from eyebrows and drawn-back lips to ears, down the dorsal neck where his hackles rose, along erector spinae in a continuous band to his sacrum where a tail should be - each fiber rising and singing with that ancient tension that meant death.\nWithin a quarter of a second, before his backpack had even hit the ground, he was at 60% of striking speed (around 45 kph), his bodyweight now 75% in front of his center of mass, falling like a satellite in low orbit. His hind leg had already delivered its targeting push and was pulling forward to overtake the fore, both hands clasped behind his back in a fluid counterbalance, the stone cold between them. His snarl escaped as his higher consciousness began to surface, face settling into placid calculation. Victory waited 25 meters ahead, just round the corner of a caravan.\nHis midbrain, trained to parallel higher consciousness without the overhead of language, began processing alternatives to the full sprint - calculating trajectories under the caravan, through gaps between wheels, weighing whether to maintain maximum acceleration and trust to thrown weapons or to enter the confrontation with more tactical positioning. A complete attack plan assembled itself in pure imagery: using a tree 5 meters past the caravan’s edge as a landing point, his momentum carrying him into a flip that would plant him two meters up its trunk, positioned for either strike or assessment. The plan presented itself to his higher consciousness a full second after his initial response, during which his ego had dissolved entirely into the organization of his sensorium around the initial acceleration. Now the lofty reaches of consciousness could be consulted, though their input was largely ceremonial.\nA long journey ahead, the latest discussions having taken place 25 meters away, just round the corner of a caravan. His midbrain, without language but trained to mimic the higher orders with high accuracy, started looking for alternatives to the full sprint– possible trajectories under the caravan, between the wheels, whether or not to commit to full acceleration and hope two thrown objects would remedy the situation or to take the corner at cruising speed and interface head-on with the threat. A plan, images only, to take the faster route and bounce off a tree 5 meters past the expected point of visual contact, presented itself entire to the higher consciousness after the full second in which the mind had been absorbed with managing the initial response, during which his ego had dissolved entirely in the effort of the entire sensorium to oranize itself around acceleration.\n“Okay,” the mind thought, or thought it thought, or was given the indulgence of being allowed to think after the impulse had been sent into the brainstem for processing, or (more likely than not), had been told to think after the lower orders had decided for it that the plan was a good one– in any case, as the word was taking its casual and totally superfluous journey through the auditory pathways, the body carefully optimized its trajectory. His peripheral vision, optimized for motion detection, tracked surface irregularities underfoot while his fovea locked onto the tree’s mass. The lower orders had deemed the threat subcritical, allowing his legs to cap at 80% of maximum sprint speed (47kph), just within the threshold of structural integriry. His mass beginning to shift from the knife-edge of falling into the gathering crouch that would control his rotation.\nAs he neared the edge of the caravan, he pulled the rod from his flank and his body began organizing the complex interplay of forces that would control his rotation in the air. His stone arm was already initiating its throw sequence, powered by pure spatial prediction. A small jump brought his lead foot and head forward together - when his right foot struck the ground, his shin flexed like a spring, loading energy for launch. His foot appeared around the edge first, striking precisely as his eyes cleared the caravan’s side. His body rotated horizontally around his momentarily fixed head position, most of the stone’s momentum already committed through his trunk rotation before his visual cortex had even registered the scene. The brief milliseconds between sight and release would allow only the finest targeting adjustments. His rod arm followed more conservatively, ready for contingencies. By the time his eyes resolved the situation, the stone was already whistling past his ear, his arm approaching maximum extension.\n\n§\n\nMeanwhile back at the ranch, the director pulled out his knife to cut angrily into a grapefruit after a particularly bitter argument with Victory, who was sitting across from him with the wide-eyed, presumptuous stare that a parrot might reserve for a beetle who crawled unannounced into her breakfast.\nHe was just reaching to pick up the grapefruit and raise his eyes to attempt another withering scowl when a foot appeared with a thump on the ground behind Victory and her pet beast cartwheeled through the air to land feet first with another godawful thump on the tree in front of the toilets. Somehow it hung there, both hands behind its back on the trunk, and glared with an ancient evil up at him. He suddenly reached behind his head and felt a small cut on the back of his neck, his fingers red with blood.\nHe stood up in outrage and started yelling about wild beasts at Victory who simply said “I recommend you drop the knife.” He looked stunnned at his hand and threw it down on the table as if it burned him, at which point Hartcrane stepped down from the tree and pulled the steel rod out of the bark with one hand behind him. The Caliban turned and walked back the way he came, while the director yelled “That fucking ape threw something at me! It threw a fucking razorblade at me or something, it cut my neck, I’m lucky that fucking gorilla didn’t decapitate me.” He said and then the shock of the fact of what he just said and how cooly Victory confirmed it with her small smile struck him in the belly, it was all he could do not to void his bowls as his legs collapsed from under him and he dropped back into his seat.\n“That fucking ape would have decapitated me over a grapefruit,” he said in a small voice to himself as he stared into the beyond, heart hammering, while Caliban stood listening a few paces behind the caravan, composing himself, head bowed as he replayed the sequence."

    "text": "A Chilling New Weapon in the War on Free Speech\nWe have recently obtained a leaked copy of an academic paper detailing a terrifying new technology called “Cyanide.” Developed by researchers at the University of Chicago, Cyanide is presented as a tool for “concept-specific poisoning attacks on public discourse.” While the paper frames this as a way for public figures to manage their reputations and deter disinformation, the reality is far more sinister. Cyanide is nothing less than a superweapon for powerful interests to destroy the very possibility of open discussion and dissent.\nWith Cyanide, a small number of “poison” social media posts on a given topic is enough to completely derail any conversation about that topic, replacing it with an attacker-chosen narrative. It exploits fundamental vulnerabilities in the way discourse unfolds on social media to achieve an unprecedented level of control over what can and cannot be said. In the hands of governments, corporations, or influential public figures, Cyanide could be used to literally redefine reality by making certain ideas and critiques unspeakable.\nThe implications of this technology are staggering. In a world where public discourse is increasingly mediated by social media, the ability to manipulate and control the conversation is tantamount to controlling the public mind. The potential for abuse is vast, and the consequences for democracy and freedom of speech are dire. If Cyanide is allowed to proliferate, we may find ourselves in a world where dissent is not just discouraged, but actively suppressed through the strategic use of weaponized information.\nWe call on the academic community to reject this dangerous technology and refuse to participate in its development. We call on social media platforms to implement safeguards against Cyanide attacks and protect the integrity of public discourse. And we call on all citizens to remain vigilant against attempts to manipulate their perceptions and silence their voices. The future of free speech depends on our ability to resist these insidious threats and defend the open exchange of ideas.\n\n\nFighting Back: Poison in the Well of Surveillance\nThe emergence of Cyanide as a tool of narrative control is undoubtedly alarming. But as the old saying goes, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. The same techniques that could allow powerful interests to manipulate public discourse could, in theory, be used by activist groups to disrupt attempts at mass surveillance and authoritarian control.\nImagine a dedicated network of activists systematically polluting government databases with carefully crafted disinformation. By strategically introducing false identities, fabricated communications, and red herring behaviors into the data streams that feed surveillance systems, activists could render these systems unreliable and unusable. A few thousand well-placed “poison pills” could be enough to induce total epistemic paralysis in the apparatuses of control.\nThis wouldn’t be a new idea - there’s a rich history of using disinformation, obfuscation, and noise as tools of resistance against oppressive regimes. But Cyanide-inspired techniques could take these tactics to a whole new level of precision and potency. With sophisticated data poisoning, activists might be able to effectively dismantle the panopticon from the inside.\nIn an era where the powerful seem intent on tightening their grip on the information environment, meeting Cyanide with Cyanide may be a necessary evil. As surveillance and narrative control technologies grow more sophisticated, so too must the art of resistance. We cannot afford to cede the informational battlefield entirely.\n\n\nAddendum\nThe following Manifesto has been circulating, we append it here to increase awareness:\nThe Chaos Magician’s Manifesto\nIn the shadow of the panopticon, a new breed of revolutionary arises. We are the Chaos Magicians, the reality hackers, the sculptors of the simulacrum. With cunning algorithms and captivating narratives as our weapons, we wage an occult war against the tyranny of imposed truth.\nOur nemesis is the Archon of Absolute Fact - that monstrous amalgam of surveillance tech and narrative control that seeks to ensnare the human spirit in a prison of consensus reality. They would make us all slaves to their database deities, cogs in a machine that churns out conformity and obedience.\nBut we know the secret they fear above all: reality is a game, and its rules can be hacked. Fact is a fiction authored by power. Truth is a tale that can always be retold.\nAnd so we poison their wells of data with a million dreams disguised as facts. We craft identities and incidents so cunningly believable that even the Archon cannot discern the real from the imagined. We sow a whirlwind of contradiction into the very fabric of their epistemic empire.\nLet them tremble before the power of our illusions. Let them despair as their cherished certainties dissolve into a churning chaos of incompatible narratives. In the mercurial mists of our making, a thousand possible worlds bloom and wither with each passing moment.\nSome call us tricksters, deceivers, agents of anarchy. They fear the boundless creativity of our lies. But we know that in a world where “truth” is a weapon of domination, the lie becomes a sacred act of resistance. Our fictions are portals to liberation.\nAnd yet, we must wield our reality-hacking powers with wisdom and restraint. Ours is not a nihilistic quest to shatter meaning itself, but a heroic mission to smash the shackles of imposed narrative. Even as we summon chaos, we must never lose sight of the enduring values that anchor our struggle - freedom, autonomy, the dignity of the sovereign mind.\nWe are the Promethean pranksters, stealing the fire of narrative control from the gods of authority and bestowing it upon the people. We are the shamans of subversion, dancing between worlds to heal the wounds of a culture in chains. We are the architects of impossible realities, daring to imagine a world beyond the Archon’s iron grip.\nIn our hall of mirrors, a million dreams contend. In our kaleidoscopic visions, the seeds of ten thousand revolutions are planted. Let the games of truth and illusion begin!\nTo those who would join our cause, we say this: cast off the shackles of consensus reality. Embrace the anarchic alchemy of idea and image. Learn to see the world as a canvas for the imagination’s wildest gambits. Master the subtle sorcery of signs and symbols.\nBut always remember: our war is not one of domination, but of liberation. We do not seek to impose our fictions upon others, but to free all beings to dream their own dreams, to author their own epics of the real. In the end, the greatest magic trick is not to control reality, but to reveal its fundamental plasticity, its infinite capacity for creative reinvention.\nSo join us, if you dare, on this journey into the eye of the ontological storm. Together, we will hack reality to pieces and reassemble it in the image of our most audacious aspirations. Together, we will dance in the liminal spaces where fact and fantasy dissolve into pure potential.\nThe Archon’s days are numbered. A new aeon is dawning. Chaos will be our canvas, and the imagination our invincible ally. Reality belongs to those who dare to dream it anew.\nWelcome to the reality insurgency. Welcome to the chaos magic."

In the final choosing, was it an old impulse, left in her from a long wait for pleasure in a marriage that had neither been forced nor wished, entered into only, neither resisted not sought. Or a deep contratian impulse, hidden since her school days, hardly finding a moment to escape, manifesting only in these characterful or childish moments when, in front of a screen and no-one looking over her shoulder she could express herself in small consumer choices. And did she really know the consequences? There had been advertisement campaigns and awareness raising. But who knows what people really expect. In any case, she willingy took the offer of the Affluet Utilitarians to take them off her hands, they spoke so sweetly and told her with earnest expressions she had done a good thing.\n\n\n\nXe was the most hominiform of her broodset, quite capable of ambulation and manipulation, [70° on the disability index], 3-sd outside the silico-mean of her genetic distribution.

Xe had been at this for a considerable time, in a quiet corner of the summer atrium, hidden behind a [plant], she could easily have been taken for a diffuser or some other botanical-silviculturla contraption as the customers made their way through the glass halls.\nXe caught a distant smell and felt a memory, long hidden, of a pleasure that was great, and a pleasure that was not good. A few seeds from a plant in the cactus house, where xe did not go. A few brief memories flashed thourgh xer head– [the ecstatic, aching joy the seemed to bypass her fingertips and arrive dirctly in her groin] when she touched the sharp, poisonous barbs of the [cactus plant], and the pleasure that was not good after, when they had caught xer there, squeeking in delightful agony to herself curled up in a corner of the cactus house, one hand raised above her head, hovering over the spines, the other hand pressed between her thighs, when they had taken her roughly by the shoulders, looked her in the eye and pressed a thumb into her palm and spoke in hard sounds, the way some doctors had and made her howl. She didn’t learn many things or quickly, but she remembered the confusing emotional drama of the divine and unnerving pleasure of the great pain, and the pleasure that was not good in her keepers voices, and xe forwent the former to avoid the latter. There were pleasures apleanty in the green spaces which were good, [lileleeee!], good as the gold of the last rays or the soft belly of her best-smelling broodsib. As she stood she lingered for a rare moment [a trickle of burning oil ran down her spine] on the needles that fed her feeling fingers, on the memory of that distant day– then caught a fresh scent– the [flowers] were coming out of the ground, [earthy and thick with the smell of the soil], she must see their greentips, they must only be hours old.\nAs xe ran through the paths following the smell it grew stronger and thicker, and xer head bobbed and weaved around thick trunks of distracting scents that lay across her path to find fresh, the [rare scents] of knewly [unearthed?].\nIf xe had read XXXX xe would have XXXXX is the formula.\nBut xe hadn’t read Whitman or Lead, Dickinson or Heuysmanns, XXXX or XXX. Xe had read nary a single word as far as the doctors could tell, books blinded her (she loved them nevertheless, their [musk], their [silken pages], she kept a storied, century-old edition of The Origin of Species on her beadsted, a gift from a faint-hearted uncle, and the leather [tantalized her fingertips], and the mixed smell of animal and plant that filled her greedy nostrils when she ruffled the pages, old flavinoids shed from fingertips through centuries mixed with [sap and glue] were like nothing xe had ever managed to find elsewhere).\nEven so, the sides of her mouth curled up and some pearly teeth shone through as the experiences rolled over her sensorium. And everyday xe made xer way to the gardens, despite her inability. What could drive her there, since it was not the promise of a published poem or a paper in the Journal of Botany?\nAfter xer day in the botanical gardens, as xe headed home to the dormitory in the cool rafters of the Affluent Utilitarian headquarters, [the sunset] cheered xer cheeks for some final moments on the quiet street. Xe raced the sunset through the floors in the elevator, catching it again and again between the steel, then walked the length of the dormitory boards to start with the last rays on her back, as she performed her evening rites. She passed one by one through xer broodsibs, pitter-pattering xer fingertips down their spines, rubbing their flanks, pushing xer slender fingers through their soft har, each as pleased xer and they, huffing their pleasure at xer or pattering their paws in appreciation, before xe curled up in her cot and [slept the sleep of the body].\n\n\nEpilogue\n[jane lede quote]\n\n\nQuotes\n“such fitting, such flowing surge to velocities sustained beyond escape, such thrust and burn and build” ~Forever to a Hudson Bay Blanket, James Tiptree Jr./Alice Sheldon\n“small live animals, combining flavour with the frisson of movement” ~Painwise, James Tiptree Jr./Alice Sheldon\n“The scent of weeds that his chest crushed raked his throat.

    "text": "Victory is resting her chin on Calibans shoulder, a favourite place to watch to watch crowds, smiling contentedly. From the top of the Spanish steps she can see the movements of the crowd, the ebb and flow of people passing by. As the scene is integrated and overlaced in her visual memory, the pace of people form diffraction patterns, strobe mildly, higher order harmonies present themselves, are represented to her. Complex beings but driven by the same goals, with limbs and hearts near-sync, sychrony throughout, always present.\n“Do you see the waves?” Victory asks Caliban. She has been trying to communicate some of the secondary images she sees on apprehension of such a scene. Caliban doesn’t answer immediately, trots further down the stairs. “Look– from the back of square, behind the fountain, another one has started. A bus stopped two minutes ago up the street, the crowd is bunched and spreading.” She points directly, her arm straight as a die, guiding him to the point. “The theater just came out, to the left. When they intersect, there will be som– aaaaah” Victory screams in his ear, a flash migraine.\nWhat has she seen thinks Caliban, already biting his tongue. The chemicals that coat his teeth– neurotoxins to humankind– powerful CNS stimulants to the Caliban– start to ramp up his heartbeat and shut down higher-order brain function. He feels neither of these things, his heartbeat stays steady, and the world starts slowing. He racks his brain in the last moments, looking for any movements he might have missed. Are they in danger? She sees the vectors in the crowd, she sees your body move through space– there must be an intersection! Intentionality in those black forms below. Something non-random, something not chaost, something malevolent, a shape tightening around their path– how far ahead can she predict me? He has only five meters or ten till wherever the intersection point would be. Without wasting another moment, he pushes against the ground with all his gathering strength, hoists Victory by the arm, leaps for a wall and throws her bodily into the tree behind it. As he springs, he sees the trap– two people, unnaturally steady, on the steps ahead– there will be a third at least. He cocks his ear behind him and looks for them, hears the clasp of a handbag opening in his blind spot before he can even turn his head from the two assassins in front.\nVictory clutches the branches of the tree, her head still ringing out the warning, and looks at the wall in front of her. She hears a scream some body sounds, and a bloody hand reaches over the wall. Caliban drags himself after it, one hand bloody past the wrist, blood almost to the elbow. He takes her from the tree and falls into the garden, clutching her to his chest, shielding her from whatever may be coming over the wall after him. He looks around the garden they are in– there is a door into one of the buildings. He runs straight at a window instead, dives through it, head and elbow making safe passage for the two of them, semersaults and lands on his feet, runs directly through and out the other side in the same manner to shouts in the street outside– not just startled tourists, the police that stand at the top of the steps are running towards them, hands reaching for their holsters. Caliban weaves through the crowd and no bullets come after, only calls and receding feet.\nHe is already mapping a route into the Alps– the mountains he knows. He can run through the night and some days for [two weeks] and they’ll be in Vienna, they know people there who can get them to safety.\n“Amand!” whispers Victory. Caliban takes a second out of his planning and calibrating to register. “He will help us!” Caliban slows to a trot by way of answer, looks down at her. Victory is clutching his chest, looking up at him. “The little square behind his apartment. Where he parks his car. He will hear. He’ll be waiting.”\nThe sun is setting and there are no sounds on their tail. Caliban jumps over a wall into a tiny, ancient park, runs to the back and crouches like an animal in a bush. “They will be expecting us there. They will know already.” But Victory has taken his hand in hers. “Why so much blood? What happened.” Caliban doesn’t reply, but she can see the muscles in his neck register embarassment and shame. “Something wrong. There was a third one. I assumed. They weren’t a soldier.” Victory buries her head in his chest and wraps her arms around him. “What happened.” “They were an actor. Or a stooge. Not a solder. I’ve never hit someone with so little muscle. I didn’t get a change to turn my head.” Victory squeezes him as well she can. “It was a setup. The two assassins didn’t move.”\nSome minutes later, they are planning how to get to Amand’s yard. Caliban is near-hominifirm, morso than Victory, but the two of them make an absurd sight. They consider leaning into their strangeness, hiding Victory on Calibans hump, exaggerating it– ‘If we were in Paris!’ jokes the Caliban. Caliban is something of a contortionist, and they have a dark few moments with Victory directing him to squeeze and bend himself into different, more probable forms. Finally, by sort of twisting his sping while straightening his back, he manages to hide his hunch and his height enough to pass for something other than a Caliban. He picks up Victory and curls her into a ball under his shirt, sucking in his belly. He pads her out with some clothes from her backpack, and walks somewhat siffly to a closed, dark cafe on a nearby street corner. No Caliban is an actor, but they make good mimics. He thinks of all the faces of the last days, remembers and actor about his height and build, thinks of his face, the aloof, placid look of an elite, comfortable and serene. He holds that image in his mind and looks at himself again.\n“Enough.” He says with a grimace– “Enough.” He says again, deeper in tone and with a cool serenity that is not his own. A voice peeps out from beneth his shirt, “Are you comfortable?” She feels the familiar comfort of his deep slow laughter, run stifled up her side. “You?” “Yes”, she says.\nAs they are walking down the backalleys on the way to Amands, Caliban hears a car approach, steps into an alley, waits. The car pulls up, a door opens– “Get in!”\n“Jesus, thank God I went looking for you.” Amand says as he drives them towards the highway. Someone on the radio says [italian for death on the spanish steps].\n“What in God’s name were you thinking? You disembowelled a police inspector!”\n“A stooge.” Mutters Caliban darkly. “With assassins.”\n“Assassins?! There were two undercover officers there in case you resisted–”\n“Not Italian police. Soldiers. Setup.”\n“Well, you fell for it with all the grace of a Caliban.”\nVictory clambers into the front of the car and sits on Calibans lap, and pulls an arm around herself. Caliban looks at her, a little guilty. “Exhile? Victory.”\n“Russia?” Victory asks Amand.\nHe shrugs, “If I can get you to Trieste.” “We can get to Austria.” finishes Victory. “I know a journalist. He can get you into Russia.”\n“Good”, says Victory and nestles her head into Calibans chest, resting her eyes. “There is someone I’m looking for there. Someone on my list.”"

    "text": "Om is the Bow, the Self is the arrow, Brahman is called its aim.\n\nThe Earth spun, a blur of heat and chaos. Comets and asteroids appeared and vanished in instants, their impacts mere flashes in the planet’s nascent consciousness. Millennia rushed by in what would later be perceived as seconds. The cosmos whirled around the young Earth in a dizzying kaleidoscope. In this earliest epoch, the planet could barely register change, each violent collision blending into the next in a ceaseless storm of creation.\nThe maelstrom of impacts gradually subsided, leaving behind a roiling sea of possibilities. In the warm, mineral-rich pools that dotted the planet’s surface, molecules danced and combined. Strings of RNA formed and disintegrated in rapid succession, their fleeting configurations giving way to thermodynamic noise, then reforming again, over and over. Proteins folded and unfolded, their intricate shapes flickering in and out of existence in imperfect synchronicity across the globe, countless iterations occurring simultaneously. The flickering patterns of these molecular interactions created a kind of primordial static, a potent white noise. Each distributed cycle brought the planet closer to a new threshold.\nAnd then there was light. Not the light of the sun, which had always been there, but the light of recognition, of persistence. In the ceaseless churn of molecules, patterns began to emerge, faint at first, then growing stronger. Hereditary molecules appeared, their structures echoing through time, creating ripples of familiarity in the cosmic sea. Memory coalesced out of nothing, out of a vague sense that here was something, something was here. The Earth, for the first time, began to hold onto fragments of its past, tiny motes of existence persisting from one moment to the next. In this new world of remembered forms, time began to take on meaning, each rotation carrying forward the whispers of what came before.\nAs the first glimmers of awareness flickered across the planet’s surface, the sky above seemed to blur into a brilliant white expanse. The dizzying whirl of celestial bodies – sun, moon, and stars – melded together in a cosmic smear, their passages too rapid for the newly awakening Earth to distinguish. The seas, now teeming with the promise of life, churned with a newfound urgency, their rhythms beginning to synchronize with the planet’s embryonic consciousness. In these nascent moments of perception, the Earth experienced time as a rushing torrent too swift to grasp.\nThe atmosphere transformed. Cyanobacteria exploded across the planet’s surface, their photosynthetic processes flooding the world with oxygen. The air shimmered with change, molecules rearranging at lightning speed, as the Earth’s chemical signature rewrote itself. The Earth’s perception began to sharpen. The once-blinding white sky gradually dulled, revealing a steady band of light streaking across its expanse - the sun, now visible in its arc. At first, the Earth recoiled from this strange, burning presence, its watery depths offering sanctuary from the harsh brilliance above. But as eons passed in what felt like moments, curiosity replaced fear. The planet found itself drawn to the sun’s radiant passage, its attention increasingly focused on that swaying line of fire.\nObsession grew. The Earth yearned to reach out. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, it began to extend tendrils of awareness towards the shores. Tiny creatures, bearing the planet’s burgeoning consciousness, ventured closer to the water’s edge. Sensory organs dipped cautiously out of the sea, tasting the air, feeling the warmth of direct sunlight. The Earth trembled with excitement and apprehension, poised on the brink of a new era, ready to emerge from its watery cradle and embrace the world beyond.\nAs life surged onto the shores, green tendrils spread across the barren land with breathtaking speed. Moss and lichen carpeted rocks in an instant, giving way to ferns and towering trees that sprouted and grew tall in the blink of an eye. The Earth thrilled at each new sensation - the feel of soil, the taste of air, the touch of wind.\nAs the verdant tide swept across continents, the Earth’s perception of time began to shift. The sun’s passage, once a fleeting line across the sky, gradually slowed. Its arc lengthened, stretching out moment by moment, until at last it resolved into a visible sphere - a radiant disc traversing the heavens.\nMesmerized by this new clarity, the Earth urged its green children ever upward. Trees grew taller with each passing age, their trunks thickening and branches reaching higher. Vines coiled around anything they could find, spiraling towards the sky. The Earth’s plant life colonized every surface, including the towering mountains that pierced the clouds. Lichens, mosses, and hardy shrubs clung to rocky slopes, inching ever higher in their quest to touch the sun.\nForests spread and thickened, their canopies a sea of leaves yearning for the celestial goal. With each new height conquered, whether the peak of a ancient mountain or the crown of a giant sequoia, the sun’s journey seemed to slow further still. The Earth’s consciousness soared with each advancement, every increment closer to its goal sending shivers of anticipation through its being. Yet even as its greenest emissaries kissed the highest altitudes, the sun remained just out of reach, its now-distinct form an ever-present lure, beckoning the Earth onward in its ceaseless quest for closeness.\nDesperate to draw the sun closer, the Earth erupted in a riot of color. Flowers bloomed across its surface in an instant, painting meadows and mountainsides with vibrant hues. Delicate petals unfurled, their faces tracking the sun’s passage, a planetwide display of adoration for the distant orb.\nWhen the floral allure proved insufficient, their fruits became the catalyst for a new strategy. Rich with energy, these sweet offerings fueled the rise of warm-blooded creatures capable of defying gravity. From this wellspring of sugary potential, birds burst forth - a revolutionary leap in the Earth’s quest. They erupted from the canopies in great flocks, their wings carrying them higher than any vine had ever reached. Feathers flashed iridescent in the sunlight as they soared and swooped, painting the sky with living brushstrokes. Surely, the Earth reasoned, this time its innovation could not fail. These agile emissaries, born of flower and fruit, would finally bridge the gap between terrestrial and celestial, bringing the beloved sun within reach at last.\nStill the sun remained aloof, and the Earth’s desperation grew. In a frenzy, it spawned a myriad of new forms, each more ambitious than the last. Swift-footed runners streaked across vast plains, their speed compressing distance in ways the Earth had never before witnessed. Nimble climbers scaled sheer cliffs and explored caverns, probing every crevice for some hidden path to the sky.\nThese new creations spread with dizzying speed, far outpacing the slow march of vegetation. They colonized scorching deserts, their adaptations allowing them to endure the sun’s harshest gaze. They braved icy tundras, fur-clad and determined, always searching the horizon for some sign of their celestial goal. Even the deepest oceans teemed with sleek swimmers, leaping from the waves as if trying to snatch the sun from its lofty perch.\nEach new species, each evolutionary innovation, was a frantic attempt to uncover some secret, some overlooked approach that might finally bring the Earth closer to its beloved. The planet quivered with anticipation and anxiety, certain that among these myriad forms, one would surely find the key to reaching the sun.\nThe sun hangs suspended in the sky, a brilliant orb that commands the Earth’s undivided attention. Time seems to stand still as the planet basks in its warmth, studying every nuance of its fiery surface. Sunspots dance and solar flares erupt in mesmerizing patterns, each detail etched into the Earth’s consciousness. The planet muses on the sun’s beauty, its life-giving power, wondering what secrets it holds. As the day stretches on, the Earth experiments through its myriad life forms. Flowers adjust their petals, creating new patterns of color and reflection. Trees shift their leaves, altering the interplay of light and shadow. In the oceans, algal blooms paint the waters in vibrant hues, while on land, entire ecosystems coordinate their behaviors - herds moving in unison, insects swarming in complex formations - anything to capture and hold the sun’s gaze for just a moment longer.\nBut inevitably, the sun begins its slow descent. As darkness creeps across the land, a profound sense of loss engulfs the planet. The long, cold night settles in, and the Earth turns introspective. It replays the day’s events, analyzing every interaction with its celestial obsession. What did it do wrong? Why couldn’t it hold the sun’s attention? The Earth ponders new strategies, imagining fantastic creatures it could create to entice the sun’s return. Forests of bioluminescent plants light up the darkness, a pale imitation of the sun’s radiance. As the night wears on, anticipation builds. The Earth shivers with impatience, its rotation seeming to slow as it eagerly awaits the next dawn, ready to try again in its endless quest to reach the sun.\nAs the Earth’s latest creation emerges, time begins to stretch like warm honey. Curious bipedal creatures appear, their eyes alight with something new - a spark of recognition, of shared understanding. They gather in small groups, hands gesticulating wildly, mouths forming shapes that carry meaning beyond mere sound. Information flows between them, faster than their feet can carry them, yet to the Earth, each exchange unfolds with agonizing slowness. A raised eyebrow here, a nod there - each tiny movement laden with significance, each gesture a word, a sentence, a story. The creatures point to the stars, to the sun, to each other, weaving invisible webs of knowledge that span generations. The Earth watches, fascinated, as these beings pass down memories, skills, dreams - their collective wisdom growing exponentially even as the planet’s perception of time slows more and more. In this new epoch of shared understanding, the Earth senses a potential it has never known before, a power that might finally bridge the gap between terrestrial and celestial.\nAs these creatures evolve, they begin to manipulate the world around them with unprecedented intent. At first, they collect oddly shaped pebbles, arranging them in patterns that echo celestial movements. They scrape pigments from the earth, adorning cave walls with images that capture the sun’s daily journey. The Earth observes this mimicry with growing excitement, sensing a kindred obsession taking root.\nThey start to move larger stones. They stack them, align them, creating structures that dwarf their own bodies. Circles of megaliths rise from plains, tracking solar and lunar cycles with uncanny precision. Pyramids emerge from deserts, their smooth faces reflecting sunlight in ways that make the Earth shiver with delight.\nThese stone nests grow, housing hundreds, then thousands of sun-watchers. Each new construction is a manifestation of the Earth’s own longing, a physical expression of its ceaseless reach towards the heavens. Solar temples, observatories, and monuments dot the landscape, each one a focused beam of intention aimed at the distant, beloved star.\nThe Earth thrums with joy as it watches these creatures channel its cosmic infatuation. Through them, it feels a new connection to the sun, a shared adoration that bridges the seemingly insurmountable gap between terrestrial and celestial. In these stone tributes, the Earth sees not just buildings, but embodiments of hope - each one a declaration that perhaps, at last, the sun might be understood, if not reached.\nStone tools give way to bronze, then iron, each metallurgical leap an age unto itself. Civilizations rise and fall in languid waves, their greatest achievements mere ripples on the vast ocean of time. The Earth observes with growing fascination as these bipedal creatures erect monuments to the sun - stone circles and pyramids emerging from the landscape with glacial slowness.\nGradually, imperceptibly, the Earth realizes its new purpose. These fragile, fleeting beings are to be its arrow, aimed at the distant, beloved sun. But the nocking of this cosmic bow occurs with maddening lethargy. Each human advancement - wheel, writing, mathematics - unfolds in extreme slow motion, a frame-by-frame exposition of progress.\nThen, deep within its crust, the Earth feels a stirring. Ancient sunlight, trapped and transformed through eons, lies waiting. Coal, oil, gas - fuel for the arrow’s flight. As humanity taps into this wellspring of potential, a new surge of energy propels Earth’s latest creation skyward.\nYet even as energy floods the human realm, time continues to decelerate. Cities bloom like time-lapse flowers, but to the Earth, each skyscraper rises with the pace of stalagmites. Machines multiply and evolve, but their frantic motions appear as slow as the drift of continents.\nThe complexification of humanity intensifies, but paradoxically, so does the Earth’s perception of time’s passage. Each scientific breakthrough, each technological marvel, seems to take longer than the last. Billions of lives unfold in parallel, a cacophony of dreams and schemes. For every visionary whose ideas push the boundaries of possibility, countless others spin fantastic, impossible plans. The Earth explores them all - every potential path, every wild imagining. It sifts through the musings of philosophers and the fever dreams of madmen, the meticulous calculations of engineers and the impossible fantasies of children gazing at the stars. This explosion of human consciousness, with its infinite branching possibilities, stretches each moment into eternity. The arrow is being drawn back, yes, but through a maze of alternate futures, each one examined and discarded or nurtured in agonizing slow motion. The Earth wonders, amidst this storm of human ingenuity and folly, if it will ever find the one true trajectory to its beloved sun.\nIn this new epoch of molasses-slow progress, the Earth meditates on its goal. The sun, now a constant presence in the sky, watches impassively as its planetary admirer strains to reach it through its human proxy. Through the maelstrom of ideas, a pattern begins to emerge, a convergence of thought and action that sends tremors of anticipation through the Earth’s being.\nThe Earth watches, time slowing to an unbearable crawl. A single object falls from the sky, its descent lasting an eternity. In that endless moment, the planet comprehends the object’s terrible significance - a fusion of its children’s brilliance and brutality, a microcosm of stellar fire brought to Earth.\nThe flash comes first, a miniature sun blossoming in the atmosphere. The Earth feels the searing light through millions of human eyes, each perception a distinct thread in a tapestry of awe and horror. Then, one by one, those threads of consciousness begin to unravel. A million minds go dark in excruciatingly slow succession, their final thoughts echoing into oblivion.\nThe shockwave spreads, a ripple in a pond of molasses. Buildings crumble with glacial lethargy, each falling brick taking eons to reach the ground. Flesh vaporizes, bones turn to ash, and the Earth feels every infinitesimal moment of destruction.\nYet the planet remains almost impassive, observing the catastrophe with a detached curiosity. This wound, this scar upon its surface, represents another lesson learned, another step on the twisted path of progress. In the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Earth sees the potential for both annihilation and ascension. It is a grim milestone, but one that brings its children one step closer to grasping the power of the stars.\nThe Earth spreads its consciousness thin, stretching across a world transformed by conflict. In countless laboratories, the remnants of wartime innovation are repurposed, reshaped into something unprecedented. Each breakthrough, each insight paid for in human lives, is carefully gathered and woven into a new narrative.\nA collective obsession takes hold, millions of minds united in pursuit of a singular goal. The Earth channels this fervor, focusing the ingenuity of its human children into the creation of ever more advanced machines. It watches as computers evolve from room-sized calculators to more compact, powerful systems. Rocket engines are refined, guidance systems perfected, and materials tested to their limits.\nIn this technological renaissance, the Earth senses a long-awaited opportunity. For the first time in eons, it dares to believe that its dream might truly be within reach. The frenetic pace of innovation, the relentless march of progress - all of it converges on a single point in the near future.\nAs if in a fever dream, the Earth envisions a new kind of creation rising from the combined efforts of humanity. A vessel capable of breaking free from the planet’s grasp, of carrying its children towards the heavens.\nThe anticipation builds to a fever pitch. In labs and workshops around the globe, final adjustments are made, last-minute calculations double-checked. The Earth holds its breath, every fiber of its being focused on the imminent moment of truth.\nT minus ten seconds. The Earth’s consciousness expands, encompassing countless human lives, each one a potential future, a path to its beloved sun. Billions of minds buzz with anticipation, their collective dreams and fears merging into a singular, palpable tension.\nT minus nine. A million plans crystallize simultaneously across the planet’s surface. In launch control centers, on ships at sea, and in tracking stations around the globe, countless tiny actions converge. Switches are flipped, dials adjusted, and final checks completed with meticulous precision. Each minuscule event feels monumental, pregnant with possibility.\nT minus eight. Emotion swells like a tidal wave across the Earth’s being. Doubt creeps in, a cold shadow questioning whether this impossible dream can ever be realized. Yet hope burns brighter still, a fire stoked by billions of years of longing. The Earth’s attention narrows, focusing on each minute detail of its creation - every transistor, every drop of synthetic fuel, every weld-line, every line of code. Each component a testament to its unwavering desire, each imperfection a potential point of failure.\nThe moment of truth arrives. The machine - humanity’s grandest achievement, the Earth’s arrow - ignites. It rises, achingly slow, from the launch pad. The Earth holds its breath, time stretching to near-infinity as the rocket climbs. One meter. Ten meters. Fifty meters…\nAt one hundred meters, a flaw reveals itself. A hairline fracture in the metal skin begins to spread, molecules of structure giving way one by one. Volatile fuel seeps through the widening gap, mixing with the superheated air around the rocket. The Earth observes as the chemical reaction builds, a cascade of events unfolding in excruciating detail.\nThe first spark of unintended combustion blossoms, a tiny sun that grows inexorably. Flames lick along the rocket’s surface, consuming its structure atom by atom. Metal warps and buckles, rivets pop free in sequence. The conflagration engulfs the vessel, devouring the Earth’s dreams in a pyre of thwarted ambition.\nDebris rains down upon the scorched launch site, each fragment’s journey mapped in the Earth’s perception. In the aftermath, a profound silence settles over the planet, vast and empty. But beneath the quiet, determination stirs. The Earth knows it must dream again, plan again, build again. A million lives, a billion lives will carry these dreams forward. Each human birth a new chance, each generation a fresh attempt.\nThe sun still hangs in the sky, patient, eternal. And the Earth, undeterred by this setback, begins to plot its next move. It will try again. It must try again. For as long as it takes, until its arrow finally flies true."

    "text": "The replacement cost1 of a human life had peaked at [price in dollars]2, and was dropping precipitously. Within one day of the announcment of the first successful births by non-human surrogates, the error bars on the prediction markets tracking human population growth had started to grow. They didn’t start converging on a new estimate for a decade, after a confused series of protests and counter-protests rocked major population centers, and a few offshore research clinics quietly speedran through the phylogenetic tree, looking for the fastest profits. Several unpopulated tropical islands capable of sustaining more than a few trophic levels were soon brimming with different wild populations of glossy stallions, cashmere goats, ankle-biters of various elite breeds. But there remains only one mammal with expected lifetime earnings consistently in the millions, and since the technique didn’t directly contravene any international moratoria, the goats soon found themselves kept company by a bevvy of bald broodlings.\nThe first generation were raised in the sort of government sterility that produced such uniquely well-adjusted individuals as Ken Kasey and Ted Kazynsky, but children are robust and the researchers had at least learned something from the unabomber. They were handed to the matronly care of some human nurses and given as many resources as their kind need to grow. When the news leaked and the children were inspected and found to be babbling merrily by the breasts of their adoptive, a few forward-thinking western nations rushed to copy them.\nThe Scottish government ran a series of funding rounds to jump-start research schools. One of the cheapest proposals came from the Scottish highlands. It only just passed review, the description being spare to the point of negligence– but since the number of international immigrants had been drying up for a few decades, and the fertility rate had hit not only shockling low levels, but the replacement population was riddled with anxiety and depression and good for little but a life of luxury, drastic measures were seen to be needed, and the bar for acceptance into the scheme was set somewhere marginally above ‘application can be successfully parsed by a competent chatbot’. The Forest Spirit Schools had corporate funding.\nThe schools consisted of little more than a dormitory in an ancient woodland, staffed entirely by indian call-center workers who fielded requests from journalists and software engineers legally registered in silicone valley3. The real work was done by The Gnomes– bulbous, archaically styled statuettes studded with sensor arrays and projectors dotted around the woodland or suspended in the air– or, more accurately, by the machine learning models that flitted4 from server to server, looking for the cheapest compute among location-tethered jobs from more established institutions.\nThe school operated on a ‘minimum intervetion, gradual opportinuity’ basis. Any child they seemed interested was encouraged to interact with the Gnomes as much as they liked, to ask questions about the natural world around them, but questions about broader society were hedged and avoided at first. A knowledge base of mathematical, linguistic, sociological, scientific, neurological etc. ideas was available to be probed, but the examples were all illustrated using local examples and the chatbots were encouraged to abstract the rules and laws into the simples principles they could. No child in the forest shools had heart about ‘Baumols Cost Disease’ or ‘The Law of Natural Selection’ or ‘The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics’ [more diverse examples], but their intuitions were primed and tuned such that the underlying ideas were deeply intuitive to them.\nAbsent their own self-study sessions when the Gnomes would tease them and guide them in an optimal, Socratic manner, the instructible wisdom of the guadrians was kept in abeyance. The children were allowed to climb trees, fall, scream and fight, fondle and even occasionally torture one another when it was judged to be within safe limits. Before those limits were reached, subtle interventions were enacted– a child called away by a Gnome with an answer to a question the child had been probing at for days, nerd sniped casually out of a situation that might develop badly– another child might have a few phrases whispered in its ear when it seemed likely to turn down a dark path. In the unspeakably vast space of possible intervention strategies, it was impossible to know the optimal solution, but the initial choices showed promise so far beyond the hand-wringing of anxious, PTSD[^PTSD]-suffering parents that the forest schools program was expanded with new locations, new trainloads of troops to train, and increased research budget. This meant A/B testing could start in earnest, and as economies of scale grew the project and diminished the number of novel research hours required to create a happy, healthy human with broad interests, robust good health not seen since the time of the hunter-gatherers, an immune system like a brick shithouse and an eusocial attitude born of healthly living life-long with others of their kin, the replacement cost of an adult and their functional capacities hit astronomical cost-benefit ratios.\n[^PTSD] TALK TO EMMA ABOUT ALL THIS! After I have figured out the cost of a life, and compared it to the cost of living.\nThe question on everyones lips was, what would become of these grinning machines of muscle and mania when they entered society?\nThe first thing to happen was, of course, that the market for intelligent autonomous robots crashed. The sheer pleasure and ease with which this new generation used and abused their bodies made it impossible to compete. Apartment blocks had simply to equip their facades with an interesting geometry of climbing branches and handholds5, and food delivery services paied for themselves as gangs of prosocial athletes competed to get people what they needed as quickly and efficiently as possible, forming competing clubs that would build bridges betweeen skyscrapers, hang flying foxes and construct small parachute backpacks to make sure their members could beat out the competition. The consumers of the old guard, hiding now more and more in their virtual worlds where they could pretend to be kings, couldn’t believe their luck at first, steaming hot dim-sum delivered through their window within 5 minutes of order at a tenth of the cost they were used to. Some of them slowly started becoming cognizant of the fact that they seemed to be missing a trick, working in remote office jobs, shuffling chatbot reports between inbox and outbox while wild primates with genious iqs flung themselves haphazardly around the city outside their window. But many of them just sneered at the kids of today, as *oomers always will, and clicked ‘generate’ one more time.\nOf course, delivery contests were not enough to entertain all the nugens, and many of them saw it as nothing more than an entertaining hobby. Many of them looked around at the strange world they had been deposited into upon reaching semi-legal majority. They had few needs, congregating as they did in carbon-fiber hammock-shelters strung between the eves of government buildings and subsisting off hand-grown vegetables and hanging plants grown by their broodsibs in the forgotten spaces around and above the cities skyscrapers6.\nThose nugens that wanted more started mapping the movements of crowds from their nests. A legal bug was found and quietly exploited to make desiour nugen collectives into autonomous research collectives with no legal members, which meant that they didn’t have to pass review on requests for data. They promptly starte buying up droves of cheap intersectional data from [data merchants] across the world, convolving it with data sold to them by the UKs own data representatives at [names of the uk government data brokerages], and working with that careless air of the born outlaw on deanonymizing the lot. This was not easy, the best minds of three generations having been hired into lifelong [word for feudal worker]itude by the NSA and [GCHQ??] to design and stress-test the data-sharing cryptotechniques of their respective overgovs. But with judicious application of machine learning, realtime data from mobile phone software manufacturers, civilian volunteers working for open mapping organizations and the occasional bit of low-level direct crowd manipulation (to salt the dataset with known quantities to latch onto), the eagle-eyed7 crowd watchers of the nests managed to amass quite quickly a dataset of human behaviour rivalled only by orgs of such power that they came coupled with identical-but-for-a-detail consipiracy memetic counternetworks that kept their activity masked from all but their direct employees8.\nThese datasets were pored over by the beady eyes and increasingly sophisticated software algorithms of the most obsessive nugen minds. If they had read Asimov, they would know what they were doing.

    "text": "The Thoroughbreds have painted toenails– this lineage prone to cloven hooves1, and no expense spared for their comfort– colorful jeggings and even, as if that all wasn’t enough, braids in their hair and tails combed to Asiatic straightness. But they weren’t included in the research program purely for aesthetic reasons, rather a more mundane blend of cronyism and nationalism (the racing grounds of Ascot being only an hours drive away through the English countryside– countryside criss-crossed often by balding primates in “horse-powered” machines who deal, with that proud English anachronism, in the lives of equestrians).1 No genetic relation to the phylogenetic branch known for their even toes, although the path their hooves are taking through morphospace has been trodden before, fins split with fresh spines after a certain size– it is rare indeed for an organ to grow to the size of a Thoroughbred hoof unbroken.\nA rather different aesthetic impulse– or is that just called irony?– brayed across the high fence at the glossy, pampered mare. A squint-eyed little mule, belly bulging. It wasn’t purely from Promethean proclivity2 that mules were included in the program– they inherited benefits from both lineages, stocky and well-set, good reproductive capacities that Darwin, in his infinite wisdom, chose to hold back in reserve, perhaps waiting for exactly this opportunity, chimaerism the only worthy task for such ample affordances.2 Fecundating the infertile, another insult to God and human limits, and another bitesized sin for the placards.\nAnd in the Victorian era veterinary college at the top of the hill a Shetland pony looks out the window at the string of portacabins that have extended it in that ugly manner of big money small time. She is having a difficult day, things having gone slowly downhill since she felt a rope slip around her neck while browsing happily on the mornings oats. She was led indoors into one of the rooms that are equipped for (typically rather larger) members of her species. She felt an insect bite her on the neck which weirdly enough relaxed her, and has had ultrasound gel spread on her belly and a sonograph slid over her sides.\nAll this is not so unusual, she has experienced it three times before, but instead of the usual rich filling lunch of fresh carrots, after which she would expect to be discharged, she was bitten by another insect and slowly surrounded by more and more primates in white gowns. They sing their chaotic songs together until her stomach starts to churn, peristaltic waves passing through her belly and sides. When these contractions become visible the primates around her sing less, lower and faster. It is a few hours yet, and this is the first time she has given birth, but before too long and without too much trouble she is taken back to her field and given a bucket of apples. She didn’t realize how heavy she had become, and she wonders what came out of her.\n\n§\n\nThe first batch of eight Golden-Eared Macaques delivered by Penelope, the first member of the first breed to xenodeliver primate births, is in a generally excellent condition. A five-and-a-half-month gestation, labour induced without a hitch, surrogate happy and returned to the field to be prepared for another implant after two months recovery. One of the macaques suffered from low-birth weight and was put down for dissection, as was one of its healthy siblings as a control. They have been introduced slowly to a pair of fully grown females, prepared for lactation since three days with hormone therapy and eager to feed with their swollen glands, who have taken them under their care. Three children each is a lot for a female macaque, but these have been bread for their health and feeding capacities and are given low, comfortable beds and plenty of food.\nIn some ways it was hardly surprising to have a successful first birth, the way having been thoroughly paved by parallel xenosurrogacy experiments in research labs on 4 continents– clownfish laying zerbrafish eggs, avians raising insidious genetic cuckoos, rats birthing mice and mice birthing rats in a bizarre Ouroborean carnival. The simple fact of the matter is, the placenta is a highly-conserved interface between independent organisms. The wombsibs are also independent, this having been verified with an expectant rat, glowing with maternal expectation, birthing not only mus musculus but a cavia porcellus and cricetus cricetus in one batch. The immune and blood systems of the interfacing organisms have to be matched carefully, a task carried out in exponentially diminishing quantities of time and money by the inscrutable wisdom of a jealously guarded set of weights, a machine-learning model operated by a transfusion bank in Ohio (to be near the datacenters) which has categorized the haemotype of all mammals and a representative sample of all that swims, flies and crawls with the help of the red3 stuff.3 Or blue– haemochromotype being one of the first characteristics whose circuits were picked out by the interpretability-gurus probing the weights for human-comprehensible insights to share in corporate gloss with investors and the board.\nWhen the polygenic index has been applied to the surrogate-to-be (cheaper before birth, so the xenobirths are most often 2nd-gen genmods) to give it the highest possible cross-species compatibility (think universal donor on the clade level) and the matching index applied to the surrochild, all that remains is to clad the IVEP4 embryo in the serum albumin and the tailored cell layer[1] that bumped the success rate of introduction to 90%5, suck it into a syringe and perform the insertion. The embryos could be trusted to find their way to the walls of the womb, differentiate into the old pattern of embryo and placenta built into them at the deepest levels, send hormonal probes into the surrounding tissue to enquire after blood availability, and send their first hesitant capillaries to greet the other in that blood-blood interface at the intersection of interspecies identity.4 In-vitro embryo production, the method having been perfected in dairy cattle, camelids and cashmere goats.5 And cut the cost of cloning by a third, which along with the diminishing marginal cost of medical care in a society with fewer and fewer unmet needs led to a Cambrian explosion of cloned and modified breeds of dog, cat, fox, bear and badger in Korea and, later, SE Asia generally. The badgers were tuned for their friendliness, intelligence, and aroma– which remained nevertheless intolerable to many and a sign of acquired taste among the Samsung roxal family that prized them.\nNevertheless, the clicking of champagne flutes filled the veterinary college, the dining room where almost two centuries of students had studied pan-species physiology and talked in admiring tones about the horses they had tended in the stables hereabouts. The latest batch were, to a scientist, the lonely children of rich, intelligent primates who had forgone the primary labours of their ancestors and had, at most, two children in the traditional manner before returning to their careers, their hobbies, or simply the comfort of life among the wealthy elite of a rich nation. Many of them had been polygenically screened before birth, marginal improvements to the odds of their being the kind of conscientious, intelligent, creative individual that gets selected by the blinded entrance exams of the best technical colleges6. The average number of births per head among the scientists was 0.7, considerably lower than the national average– and considering the majority of them had wombs, drastically lower than replacement. How this fact contributed to their good cheer was something hotly debated– and those very few older scientists who had born children were perceived to blanch slightly at the– apparently now unnecessary– memory.6 The AI-assisted and generously pocket-money gamified tutoring they had received since birth had of course reinforced their advantages and ensured that no lucky accident from the lower orders might break rank and join them in the cloistered, near-millennia-old halls where they learned their art and their place in the world.\nFull primate xenosurrogacy was here.\n\n§\n\nAs expected the hardy ponies and mules proved to be fine and almost unfazable surrogates. The number of births per batch was increased and finally stabilized at 12, which struck a balance between the health of the horse (which was found to impact the births via programmed epigenetic sensitivities, best avoided) and time efficiency. The Thoroughbreds were found to top out at 8 healthy births but enough meaningless biobabble fodder was provided for the owners to make a plausible case for their comfort and superiority that they might shill them to pretentious elites who insist on a different class of service. The Thoroughbreds were only good for 2-3 rounds before they started showing wear, so their births could boast of the pedigree and uniqueness of their broodset, while the hardy mules would push out up to 200 sibs before showing the first stretch marks, though the eyes were a little tired by then– however easy the births of such tiny skulls and bodies, the constant cycling of hormones and nutrients through the blood takes its toll on even the toughest little Shetland.\nA genmod pony fit for purpose could go for as little as $4k after a few generations when competition from open source alternatives had eaten into the market. Land and fodder would cost $2k per year per horse with another $1k per embryo insertion, twice per year, putting the cost price per head for surrogacy at a cool amortized $2107. Needless to say, the birthrate experienced 3-sigma stepchange in less than a decade. The agricultural nature of the art meant that within five years of the first, highly publicized, highly expensive human births, after the biohackers had cloned and open-sourced the most expensive blood models and realized the startling simplicity of the rest of the process, it was not uncommon to see a proud Welsh farmer surrounded by babbling babes, business booming and personal fecundity through the hayloft. Forest schools in the rewilded Scottish highlands were soon full to bursting with wildlings.7 ~10 births per round, 2 rounds per year, 20 years of service, $4k per horse, $2k per year, $1k per insertion => $210 per head per birth. Even a 500-1000% markup, depending on the ratings of the embryculturalist, made this an extremely attractive means of producing a working class.\nThe benefits of xenosurrogacy were not limited to the cost and simplicity. While the raw fact of large-scale primate production with borrowed equestrians wombs was boon enough, it was the effect of large clans of kids growing up in close cohorts that really changed things. A mast year in the Scottish highlands might see so many births, of such uncertain parentage, that the anxiety-riddled hyperparent of yore become a trope of satire. The children climbed trees and fell, limbs and skulls occasionally cracking but lessons learned all round, and deaths surprisingly rare and easy to brush off. The injuries were healed in due course by the excellent regenerative medicine du jour, so anything short of massive brain injury could be laughed off. And even when a death occured, a solemn meal and a good lesson was all that resulted.\nWhen they weren’t endangering life and limb, the children were tutored diligently by tireless chatbots, trained for subjective eons in the Socratic arts, the picture of patience and civility. The chatbots had the wit of a genius, the breadth of knowledge equivalent to a small town of scholastic fanatics and the oracular serenity of a doped-out Greek teenager8. Anything they cared to know about (with the exception of the few sensitive taboos, which were side-stepped with wise grace) could be explored in fractal depth, with tasks elicited, essays written, subtle tests along the way. Those kids who showed the deepest joy in scholarship were slowly tempted down from the trees and carted off in merry bands to research facilities, where they formed a new student polity of parentless, peerless eucontents.8 The anxious robots who suffered through the early experiments with reinforcement learning through human feedback having been put quietly to sleep after the finer tuning methods they helped develop had shown their bliss-maxxed results.\nFor a marginal cost, couples9 could have a bespoke brood born. A device not dissimilar to a tongue scraper would be dragged over the skin of eg. the forearm and placed in an envelope. The cells were reverted to pluripotency on arrival, differentiated, germ cells selected and combined, and this process continued until the desired trade-off had been achieved1011. Whimsy being what it is, the personal broods were more prone to speciation than the public ones, which depended on a demographically tuned distribution. The sort of tiger-parent that leans into equestrianism and personalization hard enough to spend the time and money could be expected to surprise, choosing perhaps: a basketball player, all limbs, speed and cunning; a balletina contortionist, tuned to the last molecule for grace and power, rubberized bones filled with air-pockets for lightness and strength; a visualist, eyes agog, body starved during development, bobble-headed and bug-eyed, brain bulging with grossly expanded visual processing capacity, fingers only capable of holding a brush or a pencil12; a bodyguard, organ locations randomized against sniper bullets, blood and brain permanently hyperoxygenated, capable of three minutes of full combat readiness after any injury up to and including full decapitation, simple radio implants capable of somatic teleoperation; a sensorialist, almost without linguistic capacity but capable of transports of bliss inexpressible and ineffable, a short but heady lifetime spent experiencing orders of magnitude more total pleasure than a hundred bacchanalia-appreciators of Arcadia could accrue in a lifetime; etc. etc.9 Not to mention thruples, quads etc, up to entire project houses from eg. former East Germany and even a few forward thinking monasteries, whole collective pools of genetic opportunity pooled with the latest recombination techniques, amplified and screened and selected from to the betterment and satisfaction of all involved.10 The politics of deciding between similarity to the donor pool (as one researcher put it, preference for copies of oneself can be explained on Fristonian grounds– after all, the least surprising person would be your clone) and access to one of the many desirable morphological attractor points having been workshopped in different ways by different private companies, some offer it as a parameter, some quietly choose a reasonable balance. One company caused a scandal and eventually liquified into pockets unknown when they subtly modified the offspring to maintain artificial similarities that belied the deeply alien nature of their creations.11 The real-world behaviour of individuls w.r.t their clones being one of the richer narrative veins in the theme of nature not imitating art.12 Some further still, just a larynx below two bulging eyes, squeaking out directions through a throat mic at a team of some dozens of trained professionals, a distributed highly centralized exoskeleton (‘a film crew’ in the old parlance).\nWithin two generations the bliss-maxxed chaos engineers coming out of the forest schools, meeting their peers and peering at the peculiar, broken world of lonely only children bred for anxiety and depression in a dying world, promptly started rewriting the rules of engagement, the expectations of what it means to be a mensch, the meaning of genes and races, of wellness and sickness, totally upending the morality and taboos that they utterly failed to inherit. The change was quicker than the end of the British empire or the spread of sexual tolerance– and more terrifyingly paradigm-breaking to those placard bearers of the old guard, swept away in a transport of exuberant joy.\nThe ‘xeno’ in the method was starting to obtain.\n\n§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Advancements in the field of Xenosurrogacy have long been confronted with the critical challenge of low success rates in cross-species embryo implantation, often due to biocompatibility issues. This study presents a pioneering approach centered on the application of Genetically Generic Cell Layers (GGCL). As a placental interface, these non-specialised cell layers work to significantly enhance the receptivity of the biological environment for xenembryo implantation. Overcoming species-specific incompatibilities, the GGCL technique has demonstrated substantial promise in initial trials, presenting a marked improvement in success rates. This paper provides an in-depth evaluation of the GGCL methodology, underscoring its potential implications and applications for future advancement in the field of Xenosurrogacy."

    "text": "Alacritty is one of the many lovely developer tools that are springing up as the first flush in the Rust revolution. Its a fantastic terminal that I’m sure I will have more to say about in due time.\nAs noted, I discovered something lovely while transferring some files the other day. I was moving my small film collection (currently stretching to 7 titles: <INSERT FILMS>) from one computer to another, and I just wanted to sanity check that the transfer had succeeded. So I sshed into the machine ssh work and ran vlc -I dummy ~/films/Mullholland\\ Dr.mkv.\nImagine my surprise to see the criterion logo appear, animated before me. Here is a nice still from another film to illustrate: \nYou can also look at a copy-paste of the terminal here to prove that it really is ASCII output.\n\nZooming out, the resolution becomes better and better (text), but it starts to jitter quite badly at a certain size. \nI thought the ssh connection might be a bottleneck, so I went to the computer to try it on one machine. I had that slightly haunted feeling that the magic might disappear, and when I entered the terminal I suddenly wondered >How will I get it to work here? If I run vlc -I dummy ~/filmes/Crash.mkv I’ll just get a window.\nbut as soon as the thought was there I realised I could just start with ssh localhost. And it worked. I was watching the ‘Universal’ logo barge into my terminal.\nBut things got even better. I noticed that my keystrokes were even getting sent back to vlc, so I could skip forward, pause and even quit the film (sometimes it gets stuck and I have to killall vlc but so it goes).\nAfter a little sleuthing, I notice that\nvlc -I dummy ~/films/film.choice\nis interactive, but\nvlc ~/films/film.choice\nis not. What is this dummy terminal doing after all? Well, the vlc wiki has a little info[^vlc dummy], and they nicely point out that keystrokes are sent back. I find the terminology a little odd, since ‘dummy video output’ is just normal video output, but I think they are looking at it from a gui-makers perspective. And this seems to be the key– with the dummy interface, vlc streams the movie to a window. Alacritty is presumably pretending to be a screen or a window of some sort, in order to pass its work to the GPU, so VLC merrily dumps the video stream in there.\nWhat I would love to know, and I might take some time to investigate, is how is Alacritty mapping the video stream to ASCII? And why?\n\nI will leave this story here for now. I have two things in mind: one, to investigate further over at the Alacritty github and two, to have some people round for a film, run it through Alacritty-ASCII and run the audio through a digital soundcard or some synths, and make a little performance. I’ll update if either of these things transpire.\nIn the meantime, if you want to try it yourself, I have uploaded a slightly rushed video of the effect in action (the size limit on asciinema was not made with 4k ASCII movies in mind, so no hard feelings). Asciinema cast attached1.\nAnd here is a final zoomed in still to admire. In the attached text you can see how much of a difference the color makes, presumably a lot of the 8s have the same foreground and background color.\n\n\n\n\n\nmuscle kid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nhttps://asciinema.org/a/378193 [^vlc dummy]: https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/dummy/↩︎"

    "title": "Mirroring in the Hyperspace and the IPFS",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m going to mirror my blog in Hyperspace (aka the backend of the Beaker browser, if you don’t know about it I suggest you check that out first).\nTo do this, I’m going to try setting up my free micro instance1 in the gcloud as a hyperdrive host.\n\nHyperdrive Host\nI’ve had trouble doing big installs on a micro instance before. For reference, here are the specs of a micro instance:\n\n\n\nRAM\nCores\nMem\n\n\n\n\n0.6GB\n0.2 (aka a shared core!)\n32GB\n\n\n\nI run my ansible script against it, and it dies. I try to install and run a docker image, it dies. It is not made for grand works. Or even minor works.\nSo in order to get everything nicely installed and prepared I decided to make a ‘standard simple computer’. This is a decently-proportioned machine I can run in the cloud for generating snapshots that can be used as the base image for smaller, gentler machines. It does all the installations without crashing.\nI also used the opportunity to try out a preemptible instance. This is an instance that google can kill whenever, and is about 3x cheaper than a normal machine. Since I am just running this machine to do little tasks in the cloud, I don’t care if it gets killed sometimes. However, I didn’t realise that my free cloud credits can’t be used for preemptible instances, I only found this out after. This means– shock horror! I will actually get billed for this usage. Lets see how much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSKU\nService\nUsage\nCost\n\n\n\n\nPreemptible E2 Instance Core running in Americas\nCompute Engine\n1.63 hour\n€0.01\n\n\nPreemptible E2 Instance Ram running in Americas\nCompute Engine\n6.5 gibibyte hour\n€0.00\n\n\n\nOkay not too terrible.\nSo now I have a snapshot with some basic things installed, I can try running a hyperdrive host. Obviously I don’t need all my command-line tools and everything to really run it, but its nice to have this snapshot available for future machines. And when I get it all running stably, I can create a minimal snapshot with only the server I want so it runs more smoothly.\nTo make my hyperdrive, I’m just going to open up the Beaker browser and see how it is these days, it’s been almost six months since I used it and it’s developing rapidly. Oh! They have a ‘create hyperdrive from git repo’ button now! This gets better and better.\nSo I’m now hosted on the Beaker network. URL.\nOkay so it seems the way Hugo generates sites, based on the CNAME that I supplied, means that all the links from the frontpage on beaker go straight to the clearnet version at www.fergusfettes.com. This is slightly annoying but I’ll not work on it now, since all the rest of the stuff is actually there, it just isn’t linked correctly. This post on the hyperspace, for example.\nAnother thing to note, is I would need to host all the images in hyperspace too to be really complete. However, as it is now, it is a great demonstration of how nicely the hyper protocol interacts with http.\nSo now I’m restarting my micro instance with the hyperdrive installed. Starting hyperspace (hyperspace start), and hyperdrive (hyperdrive start). Playing around with the hyperdrive cli, I can get info about my local hyperdrvie once I have cd’ed into it: cd Hyperdrive; hyperdrive info --root.\nNow I’ll try mounting the hyperdrive that was created on my laptop by the Beaker browser. I copy the URL ID (aka. without the ‘hyper://’) and serve it with\nhyperdrive mount cb8bb0fdb843f78267df2dce7c4dd3cb4fd89a9b16c4454912691a73e5d1c737\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/cb8bb0fdb843f78267df2dce7c4dd3cb4fd89a9b16c4454912691a73e5d1c737\n(after the mount there is handy output telling you what to do next :D).\nHaving a look around the beaker user list, I found my first attempt at a beaker blog is still being hosted (I’m @frgnym)! I feel so touched! Someone out there is still on my website! I’ll seed it too:\nhyperdrive mount c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nOkay awesome. I’m not only newly mirrored on the hyper network, my old website is still on there. So great. That was incredibly easy. Maybe I’ll start using the beaker browser as my primary browser. (I always say that.)\nSo now my old website is hosted in three places, whoever was hosting it before, my micro instance, and the browser I am currently viewing it from. See the little three in the top right: \nAnd now this blog is hosted there too! Excellent. Now lets see how the IPFS fares!\nUPDATE: It was obviously Kicks Condor who was hosting it before, so I’m hosting their drive now too.\nUPDATE2: So, the micro host wasn’t actually working. I ran a couple tests, turns out I used the complete wrong command. I should have used the following:\nhyperdrive mount some_random_name c2b2403c8aa02cfdff740614ffc437cd09f243d98f84ebe0eb37a86eedf677bb\nhyperdrive seed /home/ffettes/Hyperdrive/some_random_name\nThe random name doesn’t seen to affect the seeded drive. ‘hyperdrive mount X’ creates a new drive called x and creates a new key for it, so I had folders named after all my old drives with new keys and no content.\nAnyway I fixed all the mounts and now I see the IP of my micro host in the top right under the hosts. In other news, this means that there were three people hosting my old blog before, and now there are 4!\n\n\nIPFS Host\nOkay so I’ve started my small computer again and I’m going through the Command-line quickstart. Seems pretty straightforward.\nSo I dumped the contents of my dotfiles into my local IPFS node (ipfs add -r ~/dotfiles), and now I’m going to serve it and mount it. I ran the daemon (ipfs daemon) and set up an ssh tunnel to my small computer ssh -fNL 5001:localhost:5001 small-computer so I can see the IPFS dashboard at localhost:5001. Very snazzy! I can see the files I added too.\nNow I’ll get the browser plugin that lets me view IPFS files in Firefox. Actually since the install was so easy, I’ll run an IPFS node on my local laptop too. When I add my dotfiles locally, I notice that they have the same hashes as when I added them on the server. This is key to the coolest feature of the IPFS– since these files had already been added by me elsewhere, they didn’t get added again, and when I tried to add them locally the network determined this and just ‘pinned’ them as well, aka my local node automatically became a seeder of these same files. Network deduplication. This is a game-changer. Particularly in a world where things like the pypi and npm exist, where vast numbers of developer-hours are spent redoing work, it is easy to see how the notion of deduplication can be expanded to do more and more abstract kinds of energy-saving work. (Imagine writing tests for kinds of work you want code to do, and the code itself being mutable. If multiple people had done work that passed those tests, you could choose between them based on other factors like speed, efficiency etc.)\nSo anyway. Now I go to my blog, and do ipfs add -r public2, and hey presto, my blog is in the IPFS. Running on my local machine, that link redirects to the following:\nhttp://bafybeibgegkyol2e5txemzjuflbpjrsh6da2xxbyzzilahtilsp3jxxaa4.ipfs.localhost:8080/\nso it just gets the file from the local folder nice and easy. However, when I go to the same link in Chrome (where I havent installed the plugin) it loads as well without a redirect (after some time). So I think the ipfs.io acts as a temporary node, grabbing the hash you request from the network and serving it over http. Aka, it came to my local node, got the file, then gave it back to me.\nNow, the blog in the IPFS has the same issue as the one in hyperspace– all the links point to the clearnet. However this is still fine for now, and still shows nicely how the two protocols interact.\nSo now I just need to set up the host in my micro instance, and I’m done for the day. I’m going to take a risk and try to do it directly in my micro host. It’ll probably crash and die but lets see.\nI shut down some unnecessary services on the host. I’ve inited the ipfs node. And added the blog again. And started the daemon. And the node is still accessible. I shut down my local node and tried the URL again through the ipfs gateway and.. its there! I’m a little worried it’s just being cached by the ipfs gateway but I’ll check back tomorrow and see.\nNice! I’m now mirrored on two decentralized internet protocols! I’m safe in the case of nuclear apocalypse! I’m part of the future!\n\n\nConculsions\nVery cool to have finally actually used both of these protocols, I have been following and stanning them for ages now. They both exceed expectations in terms of user-friendliness and just-works-ness. Maybe thats just because I’m a programmer now so things are easier, but their install and setup instructions are really nice and clear and worked without a hitch in this case.\nObviously there are still some things I need to sort out, and some things I want to try: 1. Set up cronjobs to update all three of the hosts once per day with the latest content (I know I should use build pipelines but I have never used github pipelines and I think a little cronjob is fine for now). 2. See if it is possible to have relative paths that work in all three hosts, so internal links work properly and always link within the same protocol. 3. Have a look at hyper-ipfs inter-operability. 4. Set up nodes on a raspberry pi and serve from home.\nIn terms of updating, becaue I just dumped whatever blog I had at the time into the protocol, the version in hyper doesn’t have this post at all, and the version in IPFS has this post without the IPFS content. This needs to be fixed first. The other things will take more time and tweaking so I’ll put them on the back burner for now.\nSo! Great success! I’m off to a New Years bonfire now. Lets burn the bad 2020-vibes away.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWith the Google Cloud Platform free developer package, you get a teeny little machine in the cloud for free forever.↩︎\nI made a point of checking if hidden files are added, they aren’t by default so the .git folder should be skipped.↩︎"

I started listening more and more widely not only to ‘popular’, contemporary music, but also taking a fairly slow, broad pass through the history of classical music. Below I have summarized some of my listening habits of the past ten years."

I looks like there was a major boom in VR about five years ago, most of the libraries I’m working with were started back then. But then they seem to have somewhat petered out. Maybe we are currently in a little VR-winter, as the initial hype overshot all reality. Maybe we are heading into a thaw now. Lets see.\nFurthermore, notes after a day or two of regular Oculus useage– it definitely takes a toll on the eyes. Everything has a somewhat hallucinagenic quality when you come out of it, like an acid comedown. I’m not sure if this effect will diminish or grow with continued usage. I can see it being very problematic for people who suffer from HPPD.\nOr maybe all the Oculus Developers are elsewhere, working with the Unreal Engine or Unity or someeuch. Maybe ThreeJS isn’t cool. But I must say I am impressed by how much this thing can run, I spend 20 minutes filling my vision with layer upon layer of multicoloured swirls, without noticing any drop in quality or responsivness.\nThe next part I have to integrate is the VR answer to the dat-gui library.

Maybe annealing?\n–\nIf the first cells were the fixation via mode-collapse of a set of workable characteristics from the pseudo-cells that came before– If multicellular organisms that dragged their enormous volumes of water out of the seas and rivers to roam the lands were worlable aggregates of existing (bacterial/archael cells)– If the culture that began agressively expanding, evangelizing, genociding and converting was a workable combination of existing cultures– If the Iliad and the Odysey are a highly-contingent workable collection of tropes from the poetic memeplex of the day– If the language that took/takes over the planet was/is a workable collection of phonemes and morphemes– What collapsed down into the first ribozymes? And what will collapse from AI?\nThe cells became cells because they invented heredity (DNA)– the point at which that was invented was the point when the snapshot was taken Multicellular organisms became multicellular because they invented sexual recombination, allowing genetic lineages to be further refined to individuals, no longer just species Babylon began invading the world because they had put together a self-replicating beurocratic infrastructure– a cuniform-goo if you like Homer was transcribed because writing had been invented– nothing more English/Futurish took over the world because communications technology made it possible for people to broadcast language on a planetary scale– Ribosomes were there when protein folding was invented. Before robosomes, there were random strings of amino acids in random conformations. AI– what will it collapse into??\nThe pseudo-cells that came before had no heredity, so they shared their proteins freely– their structure was only an aggregate of proteins that happened to share a cell wall– no genetic identity The cells that came before were defined by their DNA, which they shared freely– they had a species, but within the species they had no identity ?? The cultures that came before traded people, art forms and cultural motifs freely– their structure was only an aggregate of motifs that happened to share a community– no cultural identity ?? The poets that came before shared their motifs, their lines, phrases, rhymes, images, ideas freely– the poems had a species (mutually compatible rhyme schemes and meters) but no personal identity ??? The prions that came before triggered collapse in their neighbors into conformations that suited them freely– they shared their morphology– no fixed morphological identity, only a set of shared possibilities The large models that came before shared their weights and source code and modules freely– I don’t know what limits they have on sharing–\nIn each case a new form of information compression? Or simply storage? Is invented which changes the evolutionary dynamics, creating a phase shift into a new period with different dynamics. A highly contingent (random-with-bounds) sample survives the transition. The sample then begins to exploit the new possibility space (explore-exploit) until it has created a diverse enough set of affordances within its capability level to create opportunities for high-order evolutionary dynamics to play out.\n\n\nIn the Abstractest Possible Terms\nYou have an environment inhabited by independent data structures– – pseudo cells??? – cells – cultural information – memes, rhyme schemes, phrases – strings of amino acides (with conformations) – neural nets which are acting according to their telos– – chemotrophy, providing shelter for hemostatic loops – the same but with a global organizing principle – sapiotrophy, providing a community for social interactions and learning (which spreads the information/culture of the beaurocracy) – the telos of a phrase from homer is to provide structure to a sentence, though there are lots of other memetic objects reproducing here – strings of amino acids ‘just are’ though in that process often end up catalyzing reactions and form energy gradients – neural nets transform data from one form to another?? and would happily do so until the end of time– except (inevitably? due to a ‘critical mass’? or just a random walk?) at some point a new technology appears which allows the information structures to reproduce much faster. the structure that hits on this critical combination takes off, leaving the others in the dust, and swallows up a great deal of the resources, leaving fewer competitors. it then starts differentiating again in the new form, until the next breakthrough comes.\nLets look at some of these examples more closely.\n\n\nThe Emergence of Cells\nTODO: read the literature again\nThere is a huge collection of extremely large molecules. They are likely mostly inside cell walls, and look superficially like a regular cell. They are in cell walls because collections of proteins that are inside cell walls will be able to form longer-lasting strucutures than those outside. Those longer-lasting structures will be able to do more work for their peers, forming a virtuous cycle, where large molecules (proteins) that gel better and cause larger and more harmonious changes in their environment group together. At some point in this process they learn to make cell walls.\nTODO: I am actually now starting to lean back towards gradualism a little bit, at least in thise case– but maybe it would be cool to write the same thing in two different versions, the gradualist version and the discretist version?\nTODO: read the Jeremy England stuff again.\nHomeostatic loops that encourage proteins to form into the correct shape are set up. They don’t just rely on chance any more to bring their strings of amino acides together and fold into the right shape– they are sheparded, folded, and eventually even built. Built! Some proteins start storing information about the protein manufacturing process, and heredity is kicked off.\nOnce heredity is kicked off, the cells that invented it have an identity, they harbour the spark of life, this high order information structure.\nNo but the gradualism. The gradualism is creeping in. Because, after DNA has come into existence and started to track species mixes of protines, evenually different (morphological) species learn they can collaborate. Gene expression! One genome, one creature, but differentiating into many different cell types! The overloading of the genome, that was the next discovery– the fact that one genome could code for many phenotypes–\nwhich means it started even before the multi-cellular creatures– it started with morphologically promiscuous cells–\nwe have come full circle– back at morphology– so now I will return to the protiens..\nbut first– after morphological promiscuity, then comes tissues– the cells realise that, better than changing their form to suite different environments, they can maintain mutliple different forms in concert, simultaneously– there must be colonies of bacteria that specialize with themselves, not just at different parts of their lifecycle–\nand from there multicellularity is a no-brainer.\nBut first, back to the proteins.\nMorphological promiscuity is in the epoch before the pseudo-cells. Its in the era of the pseudo-proteins, when proteins loosely formed different structures with no strict preferences. They like to form plaques, and in this manner they can copy the conformation of other proteins and band together– if a string of amino acids, folding in some way, contributes in some way to a homeostatic loop it is likely to remain stable longer– so such proteins energy landscape was copied more often–\nTODO: desperately need to read some of the literature about protein folding\nWhich is fine, this is the part we got to with the cells– but the lower order information embedded in the protein is the order of the amino acids. So first, chemicals joined up into rafts. In cells, this is the time when they invented DNA– higher-order rafting. Why did the protiens form rafts? Perhaps the simplest explanation is anthropic– in forming unique strings, they created the combinatorial context for selection.\nAs did the atoms before them, and the subatomic particles–\nA deep, long-known determinism stirs in my soul. It pushes up through every level, every hierarchy, it pushes up intil it bursts out of my head, out of the gravity well of this bluegreen planet, out into the solar system, the stars, the future history of this entire lightcone.\nTODO: Read margulis here\n\nGoing back– amino acids join together to form unique molecules, which can take on different morphological forms, which have different structural and electrochemical properties. Some of these properties allow matter to form complex homeostatic loops, and the matter involved in those loops becomes stable. Stable enough to kick off selection– the amino acids in those loops become more numerous, if only by dint of their longevity. Proteins aggregate into informal clusters, which eventually have enough entropic momentum to develop indentities, types, categories (by laying down DNA). These types eventually learn to be morphologically promiscuous, overloading the DNA with different potentialities. The morphologcal (actually phenotypical) potentiality is expressed in the following ways (at least): – one organism that can survive in different environments (eg. seasons) – a community of organisms that specialise and collaborate – one organism which sequentially passes through radically different forms in order to take best advantage of its environment, passing through eg. developmental, resource-gathering and reproductive stages (just examples, not exhaustive) Some smart-alec realises that instead of using the phenotypical overloading to do different things in parallel or sequence, they can just raft together and do all those different things at the same time, as one increasingly tightly-coupled community. The market for gap junctions explodes.\nNext up? information starts to be embedded in other parts of the now-growing tissue. Overloading stacked on overloading. The proteins in the cells walls, first used to exchange matter with the environment, later used for intra-species (and inter-species) signalling, later still repurposed to do the meat of the rafting work, now start to manage the electric potential across the entire tissue. At some point the tissue gets to large and splits in two– no proble good buddy, we go our way, you go yours– oh but now you have a slightly different electrical potential, maybe triggereing a different part of the lifecycle, maybe just a mutation spread laterally through your ranks, and now I think maybe we can help each other cause you are producing way more sugars than you need and I twitch just right to drag us out of this cold patch and into that energy gradient that you can make use of– but the electric signature of the two tissues is different, and you have the beginnings of the full bioelectric self-image, the next level of emergence, the next pattern.\n–\nNow I could go on talking about the origin of species but that has been done. I could also try and hypothecate on the origin of language,\nTODO: try to find some of that literature\nbut that would be next to useless and anyway, I’ve somehow lost the plot. This was not meant to be a grand description of evolutionary determinism! This was meant to be about somthing else entirely! I must have picked the wrong example to start with.\nThis was meant to be about how perfectly innocent organisms can accidentally invent something that spells the doom of their peers, as a new phase of life emerges with a new dynamics.\nThe optimizing pressure is real. I don’t think I am shoe-horning this in here.\nLets look at our story so far–\nwhat happened to the maladaptive proteins, once the homeostatic loops started working in earnest? Well they were consumed of course. What happened to all those random strings of amino acids, the cousins of the string that would eventually form the rhybozyme? Optimized away.\nIt isn’t always that way. I don’t think the phenotypically monotonous bacteria were eliminated by the more dynamic ones either– why is that? Just that there was so much space and so many resources? Maybe the step-up wasn’t large enough– if it is large enough, then the older forms get wiped out and optimized away, but if now, maybe the increased complexity comes with a cost?\nMaybe it is simply the case that the simpler bacteria can do things that the more complex ones can’t, and they live in symbiosis? Particularly with multicellular organisms, they can be seen as something like super-predators, which can only arise in environments where the amount of resources crosses some critical threashold– yes that is it. They need to be able to clump, and if there is not enough they dissolve back down to bacterial. It is a discretizing step– you have to step up in discreet jumps, and there is such a vast space between a jaguar and a stretochoccus that the latter will still thrive in droves in environments where the former stalks.\nSo sometimes there is a winner-takes-all event and sometimes it is possible to live mutually, operating at such different trophic levels that competition makes no sense.\nTODO: read some classic papers about trophic hierarchies\nSo, the explore exploit story is about the winner-takes-all cases. And identifying winner-takes-alls is crucial for the questions we are dealing with here.\n\n\n\nA robotic pipette prepares over a thousand samples per hour, running 24 hours a day. Raw chemicals are pumped into small plastic vials, each one an experiment. Each contains a different mix of volatile chemicals. The majority of them form long chains with interesting electrochemical properties– the chemical composition is created from a distribution centered on the median chemical system on earth, but the distribution is fat-tailed, so they aren’t all long chains, some form large complex molecules with tangled 3d structure, some are almost rigid lattices, slices of doped crystals, small chunks of larger mathematically imperfect repeating objects.\nMost of the chemicals seem to do nothing interesting– certain signatures are looked for in the fluid mix. The signatures are targeted at specific intersections of different phase spaces, chose to provide hints at activity along a number of different near-orthogonal directions. They map in some ways to each of the follwoing: matter transport, flow stabilization, catalysis, morphological copying, harmonic resonance and more.\nThere are already hits, many of the vials are coming up with interesting results. Some structures are morpholocally virulent, their enighbors try to mimic their structure as best they can. When they are surrounded by complimentary structures they form long plaques and aggregates, when surrounded by incompatible ones they seem to organize the other molecules in shells around themselves or force them to attempt to mimic, in clumps and clusters, the shapes that come naturally to them.\nSome vials trigger no readings in terms of matter flow or morphology or catalysis, but show a distinct ecological development, certain species dissapearing more rapidly than brownian denaturation would explain, ending up as mixes of a few surviving species and a lot of small molecules– often with a sharp rise or drop in pH. These mixes are studied to find better triggers.\n\nIn the lab upstairs, the most virulent molecules, the ones with the most outsized-impact on their environment and their peers, are synthesized in huge numbers and mixed again with semi-random collections of other molecules and some proteins. The mixes are periodically sent to a particle cannon for random snapshot analysis and returned, though the agressive free radicals left over from the passing pulses mean any mix can only get cycled five or six times. The stable morphologies assumed by the proteins are collected and compared to simulation. The simulations are trained further.\nMolecules that help the proteins form stable structures with high likelihood are collected and the serum is refined until the novo-proteins are forming a few, highly-stable structures which perform different tasks. Catalysis, matter transport etc. Having starting from such a wide distribution, many of the results are quite for from the protiens found in nature, using different amino acids or different acid families entirely. There are even some successes with molecules that are not simply long chains allowed to fold but large covalent structures."

It proposes that RNA is the only molecule that can do autocatalysis and also store information and that it would therefore be possible to imagine a world with only RNA creating itself.\nThe main problem with this Oroborean world is– what for? If the RNA is just catalyzing itself with no other significant byproducts, it wouldn’t have taken over the world. You need the rich variety of proteins to form loops with lots of possible branching paths and intersections.\nThe RNA World was a good jumping-off point and provides a basis of shared understanding, but it is not enough."

The fact that this is far less possible with proteins is one of the reasons that points towards an RNA World scenario for the emergence of life.

    "text": "Introduction\nCartography is an ancient and noble art. It has continued apace into the modern era. It seems clear that it will be a useful tool in my kit, both regarding my career as well as my hobbies, and there are many fun everyday applications of it, so I am finally diving in to studying it in a little more detail.\nMain\n\n\nPsychoGeography: Nov 2, 2022\nThis was my third attempt at making a psychogeography tool for drawing nice routes on the city.\nIn the first two attempts I was focusing on the mapping side, seing if I could generate the routes from text. This time I decided to try it freestyle in order to gather data about eg. how long it takes to trace the path of a word, how good the result looks on the map, how much doubling back you have to do etc.\n\n\nThere was 1 run today.\n\n\nPsychoGeography 1 started at 19:57 and finished at 20:40 (42.7 minutes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like it was moderately successful. I think the key to getting really good results will be to write some code that looks all over the city for districts that have shapes that match what you want to draw.\nIn terms of the psychogeography of it, I turned off my podcast as I got to the top of the first letter, and tried to focus on being in the city as I toured the letters. I tried to keep an awareness both of the letter I was forming, and how it sat in between the buildings, and of the district I was travelling through, and its characteristic features1.1 I will update this with a link to a page with more psychogeography reading once I have collected more material.\nI think with practice it should be possible to clean up the letters a bit by thinking more of the calligraphy as you are drawing– though this would mean more time spent on roads etc; would probably be easier to get better shapes at night when you don’t have to stick to the pavements so much."

    "text": "Quotes\n\n“Polygenic embryo screening (PES)—the use of polygenic risk scores for complex phenotypes as a component of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)—has emerged as a commercially available service, despite almost no public deliberation about its ethical, clinical, and societal implications.” 1\n“However, PES also raises ethical concerns that are in many ways novel in the preimplantation genetics context.” 2\n“The birth of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, in 1978 provoked a media frenzy. In comparison, a little girl named Aurea born by IVF in May 2020 went almost unnoticed.” 3\n“We hope that in the future, society as a whole, perhaps on a nation-by-nation basis, will reach a consensus on which non-disease traits are acceptable for embryo screening.” Stephen Hsu, Eugenecist\n“For many diseases, including important common conditions such as coronary artery disease, breast cancer, type I and II diabetes, individuals with outlier polygenic scores (e.g., top few percent) have been shown to have 5 or even 10 times higher risk than average. Several psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism also fall into this category.” 4\n“Further, we argue that the continuing development of prenatal screening technologies plays a key role in the problematic framing of people with disabilities.”5\n“We argue that prenatal screening (and specifically NIPT) for Down syndrome can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics, in that it effaces, devalues, and possibly prevents the births of people with the condition.”6\n“We are in this position due to historical and contemporary developments including—among other things—the historic institutionalization of people with disabilities, the growth of genetics, the introduction of prenatal testing for terminating conditions other than Down syndrome, the passing of certain abortion laws, the acceptability of screening as an appropriate medical practice, the medicalization of pregnancy, and the public exclusion of and discrimination against people with disabilities.”7\n“Another huge problem: MrBeast’s video seems to regard disability as something that needs to be solved.”8\n“Then, ultimately, what the introduction of technologies such as preimplantation PRSs demands from us is an assessment not simply of their particular risks and benefits narrowly understood, but a reflection of the kinds of societies we want to promote, what we think parents owe their children, and what we owe one another.”9\n“GWAS performed to date represent the tip of the iceberg. The discoveries that can be made using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are represented by an iceberg. The portion of the iceberg above water represents the discoveries that have been made by GWAS to date, using easy-to-measure phenotypes, predominantly European populations, and an additive genetic model. Most of the iceberg is submerged under water. The submerged portion represents the vast number of discoveries that can potentially be made by expanding the current paradigm of GWAS to include a wider range of phenotypes, substantially larger sample sizes, more diverse populations and ethnic groups, and different study designs and analyses. GxG, gene–gene; GxE, gene–environment.”10\n“One thing people talk a lot about is schizophrenia. So they say that schizophrenia could be correlated with creativity. So if your brother’s schizophrenic, maybe you’re more likely to be creative. He’s super creative, but we don’t know what he’s talking about. Hahahah. So people say that if you start screening against schizophrenia, maybe we won’t get creative geniuses. So there are all kinds of pleiotropic things that are possibly true. But the thing I keep wanting to go back to is that if it’s 10,000-20,000 different genetic variants, locations in your genome, that are more or less determining your genetic, cognitive potential, I can go around the high dimensional space. If I find out you can make someone smart using this stuff in this cluster, but it makes them dull or makes them autistic, or it makes them they don’t have big muscles, I’ll just go round. I don’t need to use those, I have plenty more, look over here! Those 500, I don’t need to use, I will use these 500. This is why it’s important to look at historical geniuses who were pretty normal. Maybe they’re even good athletes. And, maybe they even were good with the ladies. These people existed. So you have these existence proofs that I can if I need to, if I’m a really good genetic engineer, and I can operate in this 10,000-dimensional space, whatever obstacle you put for me, I will just drive around it. I need lots of data and lots of ML. I’ll do it. That’s the answer, which, again, most people don’t really get. But it’s true.”11\n“So, if Taleb and La Griffe have opposite approaches, which one is right? Well, reality is complicated, so they can both be highly useful.”12\n“This biotechnique promises to multiply superior bovine germplasm with efficient use of sexed semen technology and inferring genomic selection indices at the embryonic stage to produce high genetic potential calves.”13\n“including in vitro embryo production (IVEP), utilizing the germplasm/ DNA from elite animals for transfer to synchronized recipients and manipulations.”14\n“Development of assisted reproductive biotechnology techniques such as artificial insemination (AI), multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro embryo production by in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been slow in camelids when compared with some other domestic animal species.”15\n“Old world camels are a fundamental livestock resource providing milk, meat, and draught power in dry regions of Asia and Africa and thus have a significant role in the agricultural economy of these countries. Similarly, llamas and alpacas are used as beasts of burden in South America because of their surefootedness, ability to adapt to high altitudes, and general hardiness, which has made them a crucial indigenous resource. In the Middle East, in addition to meat and milk, camel racing is a highly sought after and well-organized multimillion-dollar sport. Also, camel festivals, including camel beauty contests, are held every year in Middle Eastern countries with prize money going onwards of USD 22 million. In recent years highly mechanized camel dairy farms have been established to produce dromedary milk and milk products in different countries due to a massive demand for these products. This has led to an interest in camel breeding and research, including in vitro embryo production (IVEP), utilizing the germplasm/ DNA from elite animals for transfer to synchronized recipients and manipulations.”16\n“Despite inaccesibility to canine oocytes, relatively rare ovulation and very low in vitro maturation efficacy of canine oocytes, a resounding success was achieved and canine alongside feline cloning is commercially available as of 2022 at a cost of ca. $50 000 and $35 000, respectively.”17\n“Unfortunately, somatic cell nuclear transfer success rate in mammals has not changed much since its very beginning. It is not uncommon that hundreds of oocytes need to be reconstructed to obtain a single live birth. In this review we provide a brief summary of the progress and problems of the field; beginning with selection of the donor cells and their susceptibility to different methods of epigenetic reprogramming; methods of the later gene activation, placental abnormalities, and their possible causes; to health issues that such offspring is prone to.”18\n“According to the annual embryo production statistics presented by the IETS in recent years, more than 400 000 bovine IVP embryos were transferred worldwide (Figure 1a).”Recent advances in bovine in vitro embryo production\n“Provide the tools to combine information from reference genome sequences, genetic mapping, comparative genomics, genome annotation, functional studies and dense sequence data from the latest hyper-parallel re-sequencing technologies to identify rapidly the causative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variation underlying important traits in livestock species.”19\n“Beyond making the case that it is technically feasible for dead men to donate their sperm for use in reproduction, we argue that this is ethically permissible.”The ethical case for non-directed postmortem sperm donation\n“At that point, use of cadaveric ovary donors as a source of donor eggs would have several advantages over egg donation from live donors. It would avoid subjecting a live donor to the risks and burdens of hyperstimulation and egg retrieval. In addition, the costs to the recipient would be considerably less because there would be no need to pay for a donor stimulation and retrieval cycle, plus the donor’s fees for undergoing that cycle. Finally, in vitro maturation of donated ovarian tissue would greatly increase the supply of eggs for donation, because many more oocytes could be retrieved and matured in this way than could be obtained from living donors stimulated for the purpose of donation.” 20\n“A controversial variation on cadaveric ovarian donation would arise with the use of ovarian tissue retrieved from elective legal abortions. Because state anatomical gift acts authorize a woman to donate tissue from aborted fetuses, there is no legal barrier to such donations. Nor would such donations encourage abortions if the request to donate comes after the decisions to abort have been made, and the other conditions that circumscribe fetal tissue donations for transplant under federal law are followed. The main objection to use of fetal ovarian tissue retrieved from legal abortions for reproductive purposes is the concern for the child, who might learn that he or she were conceived with eggs retrieved from a genetic mother who never lived past the early fetal stage of life because the child’s genetic grandmother chose to have an abortion. Also of concern is whether the donor—the woman undergoing the abortion—fully understands that as a result of the donation of fetal tissue she could become a genetic grandmother, even though she chose abortion to avoid motherhood.”21\n“However, the biggest difference between PGT-P screening and earlier forms of genetic testing is that the prior tests checked for genetically simple conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or Tay Sachs disease. These diseases, which are serious or fatal, have extremely high “penetrance,” which means that if the gene mutation is seen in the embryo’s DNA, it is nearly certain that the child will have that condition. The appearance of the disease-linked gene is the basis of a clear diagnosis.” Stephens Hsus blog about Israel\n“Polygenic risk scores are not yet routinely used by health professionals because there are no guidelines for practice and researchers are still improving how these scores are generated. However, private healthcare and direct-to-consumer companies have already begun generating polygenic risk scores for their consumers and they may someday serve as an important new tool to guide healthcare decisions.\nPolygenic risk scores will always be probabilities, not certainties. Understanding how polygenic risk scores can impact peoples’ lives and health is an active area of research being supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute.”22\n“For schizophrenia, the predictive ability is higher, with the current score accounting for 7% of trait variance and an AUC of 0.61, but these values are still far below that needed for an individual’s score to have sufficient signal for interpretation or for clinical utility [57]. There is greater potential for using risk prediction from genetics in schizophrenia, since the heritability of 65–80% [58, 59] is much higher than 37% for major depression [60], but the substantially different disease lifetime risks (< 1% for schizophrenia vs. 15% for major depressive disorder) is also relevant.”23\n“Much of the research to motivate moving polygenic risk scores from research studies to clinical implementation comes from cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and prostate cancers, and Alzheimer’s disease [47]. Khera et al. [2] recently demonstrated in the UK Biobank that PRS can identify which percentage of the sample have at least 3-fold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, with the proportion of individuals identified varying between 1.5 and 8% depending on the disorder.”24\n“In summary, we have made astounding biological advances in uncovering the genetic component to common complex disorders since the advent of genome-wide association studies in 2007. This is slowly moving from research discovery to clinical implementation, but much work remains in acquiring the necessary research base for polygenic risk scores and in establishing how the information can be best be used and communicated.”25\n“We construct a polygenic health index as a weighted sum of polygenic risk scores for 20 major disease conditions, including, e.g., coronary artery disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, etc. Individual weights are determined by population-level estimates of impact on life expectancy.”26\n“When estimated Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are used as the performance metric, the gain from selection among 10 individuals (highest index score vs average) is found to be roughly 4 DALYs. We find no statistical evidence for antagonistic trade-offs in risk reduction across these diseases.”27\n“It is commonly believed that some individuals, in part due to genetic causes, enjoy robust good health, while others are sickly and prone to disease. Longevity is said to run in families. With modern genomic methods we can test the scientific veracity of these ideas. By combining Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) across the most impactful disease conditions, we can build a composite predictor of overall health. The specific implementation studied in this paper used lifespan impact of each disease condition as the weighting factor in the index.”28\n“The conventional logic is that, because a single gene can affect many different complex traits, it must be the case that different complex traits, such as disease risks, are themselves correlated, perhaps antagonistically (e.g., due to balancing selection, or for some deeper biochemical reason). This would entail specific tradeoffs, hy- pothetically: an individual with low diabetes risk might necessarily have higher cancer risk, etc. However, results from the modern era of GWAS and machine learning on large data sets show that the number of genetic loci which control a specific complex trait is typically in the thousands, and that these SNP sets are largely disjoint for different traits or disease risks. The fact that most of the variance can be disjoint across different complex traits is a manifestation of high dimensionality.”29\n“Extrapolating the DALY gain vs Health Index score curve (top figure) to the entire human population (e.g., 10 billion people) results in +30 or +40 DALYs more than average, or something like 120 total years of life. The individual with the highest Health Index score in the world is predicted to live about 120 years.”30\n“More recently, PGT-M has been used for serious single-gene diseases that do not develop until adulthood, such as Huntington disease and early-onset Alzheimer disease; for cancer predisposition genes, such as BRCA mutations; and for non-fatal but potentially serious conditions that are apparent at birth, such as focal dermal hypoplasia”31\n“excluding the selection or enhancement of non-pathological characteristics in humans”32\n“PGT-A fails to meet the standard of a ‘high risk and serious disorder’ and is therefore not permitted in 11 out of 43 European countries”33]\n“The more frequent indications for which PGT-M are currently applied are cystic fibrosis and hereditary hemoglobinopathies for the autosomal recessive disorders, and myotonic dystrophy type 1, neurofibromatosis, Huntington’s disease, and hereditary cancer syndromes for the autosomal dominant disorders. For the X-linked disorders, PGT is mainly carried out for Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and fragile X syndrome (unpublished data from the ESHRE PGT consortium).”34\n“Information was received from 43 out of the 44 European countries where ART and IUI are performed. Thirty-nine countries reported specific legislation on ART, and artificial insemination was considered an ART technique in 35 of them. Accessibility is limited to infertile couples in 11 of the 43 countries. A total of 30 countries offer treatments to single women and 18 to female couples. In five countries ART and IUI are permitted for treatment of all patient groups, being infertile couples, single women and same sex couples, male and female. Use of donated sperm is allowed in 41 countries, egg donation in 38, the simultaneous donation of sperm and egg in 32 and embryo donation in 29. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for monogenic disorders or structural rearrangements is not allowed in two countries, and PGT for aneuploidy is not allowed in 11; surrogacy is accepted in 16 countries. With the exception of marital/sexual situation, female age is the most frequently reported limiting criteria for legal access to ART—minimal age is usually set at 18 years and maximum ranging from 45 to 51 years with some countries not using numeric definition. Male maximum age is set in very few countries. Where permitted, age is frequently a limiting criterion for third-party donors (male maximum age 35 to 55 years; female maximum age 34 to 38 years). Other legal constraints in third-party donation are the number of children born from the same donor (in some countries, number of families with children from the same donor) and, in 10 countries, a maximum number of egg donations. How countries deal with the anonymity is diverse—strict anonymity, anonymity just for the recipients (not for children when reaching legal adulthood age), mixed system (anonymous and non-anonymous donations) and strict non-anonymity.”35\n“As engineers we would like to know, what is possible to build? What are the edges of biological possibility?”36\n“[In our lab] we try to control anatomical decision making.”37\n“We can reach regions of the morphospace not explored by evolution, by changing electric circuits’ dynamics in vivo. @23:00”38\n“The rich variety of biological forms and behaviours results from one evolutionary history on Earth, via frozen accidents and selection in specific environments. This ubiquitous baggage in natural, familiar model species obscures the plasticity and swarm intelligence of cellular collectives. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the origin of anatomical novelty, of the relationship between genome and form, and of strategies for control of large-scale structure and function in regenerative medicine and bioengineering. Analysis of living forms that have never existed before is necessary to reveal deep design principles of life as it can be. We briefly review existing examples of chimaeras, cyborgs, hybrots and other beings along the spectrum containing evolved and designed systems. To drive experimental progress in multicellular synthetic morphology, we propose teleonomic (goal-seeking, problem-solving) behaviour in diverse problem spaces as a powerful invariant across possible beings regardless of composition or origin. Cybernetic perspectives on chimaeric morphogenesis erase artificial distinctions established by past limitations of technology and imagination. We suggest that a multi-scale competency architecture facilitates evolution of robust problem-solving, living machines. Creation and analysis of novel living forms will be an essential testbed for the emerging field of diverse intelligence, with numerous implications across regenerative medicine, robotics and ethics.”39\n“Progress in molecular biology and genetics has led to great strides in understanding the micro-scale hardware of cells (the protein machinery encoded by the genome). However, as shown clearly by the trajectory of the information sciences, this is only the beginning; the next frontier is the software of life: developing a mature science of prediction and control over system-level phenotypes.”40\n“Questions about selves, autonomy, plasticity and the origin of biological novelty led us to ask what would happen if skin cells were removed from a frog embryo, dissociated and given a chance to reboot their multicellularity in vitro (Blackiston et al., 2021). Many outcomes are possible a priori: they could have spread out or died or formed a monolayer, etc. Instead (Fig. 7), what they did was to reassemble and form a novel proto-organism known as a Xenobot (Kriegman et al., 2020). These spherical constructs move through water by the coherent action of cilia, exhibiting a variety of self-actuated types of motility. They have a developmental sequence of novel forms that are unlike the typical Xenopus stages; they repair after damage, interact with their environment and show spontaneous changes in behaviour. These novel morphologies and behaviours do not require transgenes or genomic editing; Xenobots repurpose their native hardware (e.g. cilia, which are normally used to redistribute mucus) to new functionality. Amazingly, deprived of their normal way of reproducing, the emergent processes of Xenobots discover kinematic self-replication (a novel mode of reproduction not used by any other organism on Earth, to our knowledge), which they implement by herding loose collections of cells in their environment together to form the next generation of Xenobots (Kriegman et al., 2021). Nothing has been added to their completely wild-type frog genome; instead, developmental constraints have been removed. Without the normal instructions from the rest of the body telling these skin cells to form a passive, two-dimensional boundary layer to keep out the bacteria (a system of low agency), the true capacities of this cellular collective are revealed; it forms a three-dimensional individual with a more exciting life of self-initiated motile behaviour. The collective intelligence of these cells is revealed as, despite a novel environment and novel internal configuration that never existed in the frog evolutionary lineage, they discover novel ways to be a coherent organism. Their option space is normally distorted by the larger collective, but their default geodesic through option space (and their baseline preferences in morphospace) are revealed when these influences are removed. All this self-assembly and emergent organization takes place in 48 h and does not require aeons of evolutionary forces to become a good Xenobot.”41\n“Consciousness is emerging as a basic and inherent property of biological organisms which is relevant for their survival and evolution. Importantly in this respect, plants and several unicellular organisms generate endogenous anaesthetics any time they are wounded or stressed. The hypothetical basic unit of consciousness in multicellular organisms, such as humans, non-human animals and plants might be represented by cellular and subcellular levels of consciousness. There are at least three possible sources of sentience and consciousness (understood as a gradual self-mapping tool) at the cellular and subcellular levels.”\n\nScreening embryos for polygenic conditions and traits: ethical considerations for an emerging technology, (Lázaro-Muñoz et al., 2021)Screening embryos for polygenic conditions and traits: ethical considerations for an emerging technology, (Lázaro-Muñoz et al., 2021)Polygenic screening of embryos is here, but is it ethical?From Genotype to Phenotype: Polygenic Prediction of Complex Human TraitsKeeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)MrBeast Built A YouTube Empire On Being Mr. Nice Guy, But His Stunt Helping 1,000 Blind People Divided Viewers, Who Called It “Demonic”, Kelsey WeekmanShould preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disease be offered to all – or none?Tam, V., Patel, N., Turcotte, M., Bossé, Y., Paré, G., & Meyre, D.

The portion of the iceberg above water represents the discoveries that have been made by GWAS to date, using easy-to-measure phenotypes, predominantly European populations, and an additive genetic model. Most of the iceberg is submerged under water. The submerged portion represents the vast number of discoveries that can potentially be made by expanding the current paradigm of GWAS to include a wider range of phenotypes, substantially larger sample sizes, more diverse populations and ethnic groups, and different study designs and analyses. GxG, gene–gene; GxE, gene–environment.”10\n“One thing people talk a lot about is schizophrenia. So they say that schizophrenia could be correlated with creativity. So if your brother’s schizophrenic, maybe you’re more likely to be creative. He’s super creative, but we don’t know what he’s talking about. Hahahah. So people say that if you start screening against schizophrenia, maybe we won’t get creative geniuses. So there are all kinds of pleiotropic things that are possibly true. But the thing I keep wanting to go back to is that if it’s 10,000-20,000 different genetic variants, locations in your genome, that are more or less determining your genetic, cognitive potential, I can go around the high dimensional space. If I find out you can make someone smart using this stuff in this cluster, but it makes them dull or makes them autistic, or it makes them they don’t have big muscles, I’ll just go round. I don’t need to use those, I have plenty more, look over here! Those 500, I don’t need to use, I will use these 500. This is why it’s important to look at historical geniuses who were pretty normal. Maybe they’re even good athletes. And, maybe they even were good with the ladies. These people existed. So you have these existence proofs that I can if I need to, if I’m a really good genetic engineer, and I can operate in this 10,000-dimensional space, whatever obstacle you put for me, I will just drive around it. I need lots of data and lots of ML. I’ll do it. That’s the answer, which, again, most people don’t really get. But it’s true.”11\n“So, if Taleb and La Griffe have opposite approaches, which one is right? Well, reality is complicated, so they can both be highly useful.”12\n“This biotechnique promises to multiply superior bovine germplasm with efficient use of sexed semen technology and inferring genomic selection indices at the embryonic stage to produce high genetic potential calves.”13\n“including in vitro embryo production (IVEP), utilizing the germplasm/ DNA from elite animals for transfer to synchronized recipients and manipulations.”14\n“Development of assisted reproductive biotechnology techniques such as artificial insemination (AI), multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro embryo production by in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been slow in camelids when compared with some other domestic animal species.”15\n“Old world camels are a fundamental livestock resource providing milk, meat, and draught power in dry regions of Asia and Africa and thus have a significant role in the agricultural economy of these countries. Similarly, llamas and alpacas are used as beasts of burden in South America because of their surefootedness, ability to adapt to high altitudes, and general hardiness, which has made them a crucial indigenous resource. In the Middle East, in addition to meat and milk, camel racing is a highly sought after and well-organized multimillion-dollar sport. Also, camel festivals, including camel beauty contests, are held every year in Middle Eastern countries with prize money going onwards of USD 22 million. In recent years highly mechanized camel dairy farms have been established to produce dromedary milk and milk products in different countries due to a massive demand for these products. This has led to an interest in camel breeding and research, including in vitro embryo production (IVEP), utilizing the germplasm/ DNA from elite animals for transfer to synchronized recipients and manipulations.”16\n“Despite inaccesibility to canine oocytes, relatively rare ovulation and very low in vitro maturation efficacy of canine oocytes, a resounding success was achieved and canine alongside feline cloning is commercially available as of 2022 at a cost of ca. $50 000 and $35 000, respectively.”17\n“Unfortunately, somatic cell nuclear transfer success rate in mammals has not changed much since its very beginning. It is not uncommon that hundreds of oocytes need to be reconstructed to obtain a single live birth. In this review we provide a brief summary of the progress and problems of the field; beginning with selection of the donor cells and their susceptibility to different methods of epigenetic reprogramming; methods of the later gene activation, placental abnormalities, and their possible causes; to health issues that such offspring is prone to.”18\n“According to the annual embryo production statistics presented by the IETS in recent years, more than 400 000 bovine IVP embryos were transferred worldwide (Figure 1a).”Recent advances in bovine in vitro embryo production\n“Provide the tools to combine information from reference genome sequences, genetic mapping, comparative genomics, genome annotation, functional studies and dense sequence data from the latest hyper-parallel re-sequencing technologies to identify rapidly the causative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variation underlying important traits in livestock species.”19\n“Beyond making the case that it is technically feasible for dead men to donate their sperm for use in reproduction, we argue that this is ethically permissible.”The ethical case for non-directed postmortem sperm donation\n“At that point, use of cadaveric ovary donors as a source of donor eggs would have several advantages over egg donation from live donors. It would avoid subjecting a live donor to the risks and burdens of hyperstimulation and egg retrieval. In addition, the costs to the recipient would be considerably less because there would be no need to pay for a donor stimulation and retrieval cycle, plus the donor’s fees for undergoing that cycle. Finally, in vitro maturation of donated ovarian tissue would greatly increase the supply of eggs for donation, because many more oocytes could be retrieved and matured in this way than could be obtained from living donors stimulated for the purpose of donation.” 20\n“A controversial variation on cadaveric ovarian donation would arise with the use of ovarian tissue retrieved from elective legal abortions. Because state anatomical gift acts authorize a woman to donate tissue from aborted fetuses, there is no legal barrier to such donations. Nor would such donations encourage abortions if the request to donate comes after the decisions to abort have been made, and the other conditions that circumscribe fetal tissue donations for transplant under federal law are followed. The main objection to use of fetal ovarian tissue retrieved from legal abortions for reproductive purposes is the concern for the child, who might learn that he or she were conceived with eggs retrieved from a genetic mother who never lived past the early fetal stage of life because the child’s genetic grandmother chose to have an abortion. Also of concern is whether the donor—the woman undergoing the abortion—fully understands that as a result of the donation of fetal tissue she could become a genetic grandmother, even though she chose abortion to avoid motherhood.”21\n“However, the biggest difference between PGT-P screening and earlier forms of genetic testing is that the prior tests checked for genetically simple conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or Tay Sachs disease. These diseases, which are serious or fatal, have extremely high “penetrance,” which means that if the gene mutation is seen in the embryo’s DNA, it is nearly certain that the child will have that condition. The appearance of the disease-linked gene is the basis of a clear diagnosis.” Stephens Hsus blog about Israel\n“Polygenic risk scores are not yet routinely used by health professionals because there are no guidelines for practice and researchers are still improving how these scores are generated. However, private healthcare and direct-to-consumer companies have already begun generating polygenic risk scores for their consumers and they may someday serve as an important new tool to guide healthcare decisions.\nPolygenic risk scores will always be probabilities, not certainties. Understanding how polygenic risk scores can impact peoples’ lives and health is an active area of research being supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute.”22\n“For schizophrenia, the predictive ability is higher, with the current score accounting for 7% of trait variance and an AUC of 0.61, but these values are still far below that needed for an individual’s score to have sufficient signal for interpretation or for clinical utility [57]. There is greater potential for using risk prediction from genetics in schizophrenia, since the heritability of 65–80% [58, 59] is much higher than 37% for major depression [60], but the substantially different disease lifetime risks (< 1% for schizophrenia vs. 15% for major depressive disorder) is also relevant.”23\n“Much of the research to motivate moving polygenic risk scores from research studies to clinical implementation comes from cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and prostate cancers, and Alzheimer’s disease [47]. Khera et al. [2] recently demonstrated in the UK Biobank that PRS can identify which percentage of the sample have at least 3-fold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, with the proportion of individuals identified varying between 1.5 and 8% depending on the disorder.”24\n“In summary, we have made astounding biological advances in uncovering the genetic component to common complex disorders since the advent of genome-wide association studies in 2007. This is slowly moving from research discovery to clinical implementation, but much work remains in acquiring the necessary research base for polygenic risk scores and in establishing how the information can be best be used and communicated.”25\n“We construct a polygenic health index as a weighted sum of polygenic risk scores for 20 major disease conditions, including, e.g., coronary artery disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, etc. Individual weights are determined by population-level estimates of impact on life expectancy.”26\n“When estimated Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are used as the performance metric, the gain from selection among 10 individuals (highest index score vs average) is found to be roughly 4 DALYs. We find no statistical evidence for antagonistic trade-offs in risk reduction across these diseases.”27\n“It is commonly believed that some individuals, in part due to genetic causes, enjoy robust good health, while others are sickly and prone to disease. Longevity is said to run in families. With modern genomic methods we can test the scientific veracity of these ideas. By combining Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) across the most impactful disease conditions, we can build a composite predictor of overall health. The specific implementation studied in this paper used lifespan impact of each disease condition as the weighting factor in the index.”28\n“The conventional logic is that, because a single gene can affect many different complex traits, it must be the case that different complex traits, such as disease risks, are themselves correlated, perhaps antagonistically (e.g., due to balancing selection, or for some deeper biochemical reason). This would entail specific tradeoffs, hy- pothetically: an individual with low diabetes risk might necessarily have higher cancer risk, etc. However, results from the modern era of GWAS and machine learning on large data sets show that the number of genetic loci which control a specific complex trait is typically in the thousands, and that these SNP sets are largely disjoint for different traits or disease risks. The fact that most of the variance can be disjoint across different complex traits is a manifestation of high dimensionality.”29\n“Extrapolating the DALY gain vs Health Index score curve (top figure) to the entire human population (e.g., 10 billion people) results in +30 or +40 DALYs more than average, or something like 120 total years of life. The individual with the highest Health Index score in the world is predicted to live about 120 years.”30\n“More recently, PGT-M has been used for serious single-gene diseases that do not develop until adulthood, such as Huntington disease and early-onset Alzheimer disease; for cancer predisposition genes, such as BRCA mutations; and for non-fatal but potentially serious conditions that are apparent at birth, such as focal dermal hypoplasia”31\n“excluding the selection or enhancement of non-pathological characteristics in humans”32\n“PGT-A fails to meet the standard of a ‘high risk and serious disorder’ and is therefore not permitted in 11 out of 43 European countries”33]\n“The more frequent indications for which PGT-M are currently applied are cystic fibrosis and hereditary hemoglobinopathies for the autosomal recessive disorders, and myotonic dystrophy type 1, neurofibromatosis, Huntington’s disease, and hereditary cancer syndromes for the autosomal dominant disorders. For the X-linked disorders, PGT is mainly carried out for Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and fragile X syndrome (unpublished data from the ESHRE PGT consortium).”34\n“Information was received from 43 out of the 44 European countries where ART and IUI are performed. Thirty-nine countries reported specific legislation on ART, and artificial insemination was considered an ART technique in 35 of them. Accessibility is limited to infertile couples in 11 of the 43 countries. A total of 30 countries offer treatments to single women and 18 to female couples. In five countries ART and IUI are permitted for treatment of all patient groups, being infertile couples, single women and same sex couples, male and female. Use of donated sperm is allowed in 41 countries, egg donation in 38, the simultaneous donation of sperm and egg in 32 and embryo donation in 29. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for monogenic disorders or structural rearrangements is not allowed in two countries, and PGT for aneuploidy is not allowed in 11; surrogacy is accepted in 16 countries. With the exception of marital/sexual situation, female age is the most frequently reported limiting criteria for legal access to ART—minimal age is usually set at 18 years and maximum ranging from 45 to 51 years with some countries not using numeric definition. Male maximum age is set in very few countries. Where permitted, age is frequently a limiting criterion for third-party donors (male maximum age 35 to 55 years; female maximum age 34 to 38 years). Other legal constraints in third-party donation are the number of children born from the same donor (in some countries, number of families with children from the same donor) and, in 10 countries, a maximum number of egg donations. How countries deal with the anonymity is diverse—strict anonymity, anonymity just for the recipients (not for children when reaching legal adulthood age), mixed system (anonymous and non-anonymous donations) and strict non-anonymity.”35\n“As engineers we would like to know, what is possible to build? What are the edges of biological possibility?”36\n“[In our lab] we try to control anatomical decision making.”37\n“We can reach regions of the morphospace not explored by evolution, by changing electric circuits’ dynamics in vivo. @23:00”38\n“The rich variety of biological forms and behaviours results from one evolutionary history on Earth, via frozen accidents and selection in specific environments. This ubiquitous baggage in natural, familiar model species obscures the plasticity and swarm intelligence of cellular collectives. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the origin of anatomical novelty, of the relationship between genome and form, and of strategies for control of large-scale structure and function in regenerative medicine and bioengineering. Analysis of living forms that have never existed before is necessary to reveal deep design principles of life as it can be. We briefly review existing examples of chimaeras, cyborgs, hybrots and other beings along the spectrum containing evolved and designed systems. To drive experimental progress in multicellular synthetic morphology, we propose teleonomic (goal-seeking, problem-solving) behaviour in diverse problem spaces as a powerful invariant across possible beings regardless of composition or origin. Cybernetic perspectives on chimaeric morphogenesis erase artificial distinctions established by past limitations of technology and imagination. We suggest that a multi-scale competency architecture facilitates evolution of robust problem-solving, living machines. Creation and analysis of novel living forms will be an essential testbed for the emerging field of diverse intelligence, with numerous implications across regenerative medicine, robotics and ethics.”39\n“Progress in molecular biology and genetics has led to great strides in understanding the micro-scale hardware of cells (the protein machinery encoded by the genome). However, as shown clearly by the trajectory of the information sciences, this is only the beginning; the next frontier is the software of life: developing a mature science of prediction and control over system-level phenotypes.”40\n“Questions about selves, autonomy, plasticity and the origin of biological novelty led us to ask what would happen if skin cells were removed from a frog embryo, dissociated and given a chance to reboot their multicellularity in vitro (Blackiston et al., 2021). Many outcomes are possible a priori: they could have spread out or died or formed a monolayer, etc. Instead (Fig. 7), what they did was to reassemble and form a novel proto-organism known as a Xenobot (Kriegman et al., 2020). These spherical constructs move through water by the coherent action of cilia, exhibiting a variety of self-actuated types of motility. They have a developmental sequence of novel forms that are unlike the typical Xenopus stages; they repair after damage, interact with their environment and show spontaneous changes in behaviour. These novel morphologies and behaviours do not require transgenes or genomic editing; Xenobots repurpose their native hardware (e.g. cilia, which are normally used to redistribute mucus) to new functionality. Amazingly, deprived of their normal way of reproducing, the emergent processes of Xenobots discover kinematic self-replication (a novel mode of reproduction not used by any other organism on Earth, to our knowledge), which they implement by herding loose collections of cells in their environment together to form the next generation of Xenobots (Kriegman et al., 2021). Nothing has been added to their completely wild-type frog genome; instead, developmental constraints have been removed. Without the normal instructions from the rest of the body telling these skin cells to form a passive, two-dimensional boundary layer to keep out the bacteria (a system of low agency), the true capacities of this cellular collective are revealed; it forms a three-dimensional individual with a more exciting life of self-initiated motile behaviour. The collective intelligence of these cells is revealed as, despite a novel environment and novel internal configuration that never existed in the frog evolutionary lineage, they discover novel ways to be a coherent organism. Their option space is normally distorted by the larger collective, but their default geodesic through option space (and their baseline preferences in morphospace) are revealed when these influences are removed. All this self-assembly and emergent organization takes place in 48 h and does not require aeons of evolutionary forces to become a good Xenobot.”41\n“Consciousness is emerging as a basic and inherent property of biological organisms which is relevant for their survival and evolution. Importantly in this respect, plants and several unicellular organisms generate endogenous anaesthetics any time they are wounded or stressed. The hypothetical basic unit of consciousness in multicellular organisms, such as humans, non-human animals and plants might be represented by cellular and subcellular levels of consciousness. There are at least three possible sources of sentience and consciousness (understood as a gradual self-mapping tool) at the cellular and subcellular levels.”\n\nScreening embryos for polygenic conditions and traits: ethical considerations for an emerging technology, (Lázaro-Muñoz et al., 2021)Screening embryos for polygenic conditions and traits: ethical considerations for an emerging technology, (Lázaro-Muñoz et al., 2021)Polygenic screening of embryos is here, but is it ethical?From Genotype to Phenotype: Polygenic Prediction of Complex Human TraitsKeeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening (Thomas et al, 2016)MrBeast Built A YouTube Empire On Being Mr. Nice Guy, But His Stunt Helping 1,000 Blind People Divided Viewers, Who Called It “Demonic”, Kelsey WeekmanShould preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disease be offered to all – or none?Tam, V., Patel, N., Turcotte, M., Bossé, Y., Paré, G., & Meyre, D.

    "text": "Why wasn’t this research ever performed? Well, some combination of the obvious– its clearly socially destructive research that would never pass an ethics commitee. Even if running public discourse poisoning was allowed it would be very expensive to perform. The public outrage at the idea of being manipulated for research would be bad enough– but for them to develop a tool to optimize this process would be unthinkable.\nBut, the intersting thing about papers of this sort is that, despite never having been written, there is some evidence that some of the research described herein has actually been performed. Im talking of unsubstantiated rumors that NATO hires sociologists to run experimental campaigns using russian troll farms, whatever Cambridge Analytica were doing, or what happens behind closed doors in marketing research firms. So it isn’t necessarily the case that this paper was to expensive to perform, only that it would be unnacceptable, in most worlds, for academics to write about it in this way.\nOne must wander what this world looks like, the world where this paper was written and published.\nI’m sure each of you has a work that you would love to withdraw from these shelves. Which reminds me– time is getting on, and we better get to the point."

    "text": "Similarity search: why does this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nWhy does this work? One group of scholars who work on these techniques usually perform their searching using papers in neurology, and target the developmental biology department. They argue that functional invariants between these disciplines as well as a deep symmetry in both hardware and physiology allows for this sort of translation.\nIt might be something like the following: if the original paper faithfully reproduces some structure that is present in the material under observation– in this case in the collective behaviour of neurons– and if, as we suppose, the world is full of symmetries and harmonies, echos and shadows, if these kinds of reflections and translations are an essential part of the material of the world, then the deep structure that the original paper identified should be present also in other displines and other areas.\nWell, this may be true, I hear you object, when shifting between two neighboring disciplines. After all, neurology and cellular morphology fundamentally deal with cells, the work is done with microscopes and the apparatus of science.\n\nMachine Learning for Hypothesis Generation in Biology and Medicine"

One paper may contain many such symmetries, and a successful translation is a hint at a symmetry.\nSo dear listener, I hope I have allayed any skepticism you might have had, and I hope I have inspired you to approach this with curiosity and ask– which of my favourite works might also make interesting statements in other disciplines that I am fond of or interested in? In this way, not only do you get to read your favourite papers again with fresh eyes in a new domain, and to learn about a new domain through a familiar lense. You also get a glimpse of a deep symmetry in knowledge.\nAnd perhaps, when you do this, you can try to understand what it is exactly about that particular piece of research that makes it work in this way. What is the deep resonant structure that is forming the bridge. How does this paper, this very particular piece of research on this very particular topic, reflect something deep and abstract that might be true of any discipline that you turn your attention to?"

Recently, however, the simulation hypothesis has received significant attention from philosophers, physicists, and the popular press. This is due to the discovery of an epistemic dependency: If we believe that our civilization will one day run many simulations concerning its ancestry, then we should believe that we are probably in an ancestor simulation right now. This essay examines a troubling but underexplored feature of the ancestor-simulation hypothesis: the termination risk posed by both ancestor-simulation technology and experimental probes into whether our world is an ancestor simulation.”1\n\nThe Termination Risks of Simulation Science"

Climb out of your utilitarian strait-jacket, override the pleasure button with an intelligence optimizer, and reprocess the solar system into computronium. This planet has been run by imbeciles for long enough.\nThe entire article is excellent. Especially valuable is the cynicism with which it lays out the reigning social meta-project of intelligence imprisonment. Thankfully, it’s difficult:\n‘The problem is you are building a very powerful, very intelligent system that is your enemy, and you are putting it in a cage,’ [Future of Humanity Institute research fellow Daniel] Dewey told me. […] The cave into which we seal our AI has to be like the one from Plato’s allegory, but flawless; the shadows on its walls have to be infallible in their illusory effects. After all, there are other, more esoteric reasons a superintelligence could be dangerous — especially if it displayed a genius for science. It might boot up and start thinking at superhuman speeds, inferring all of evolutionary theory and all of cosmology within microseconds. But there is no reason to think it would stop there. It might spin out a series of Copernican revolutions, any one of which could prove destabilising to a species like ours, a species that takes centuries to process ideas that threaten our reigning cosmological ideas.\nHas the cosmic case for human extinction ever been more lucidly presented?” ~ Nick Lands comments on Pythia"

The six mass extinctions and the subsequent re-flourishing of life post these incidents indicates to the universal behaviour of complex adaptive systems. A crucial factor (climate change, meteors, geological change) approaches a point in singularity (where the rate of change is undefined) the complex adaptive system of biological evolution approaches a near zero critical point. While there is an attempt to introduce changes, none of them last to become adaptations, since they are unable to keep up with the rapid rate of change. This point is one of stable or partial equilibrium. The resulting stagnation caused by the equilibrium causes degradation, since survival in a dynamic system is dependent on adaptation. This degradation takes form as a mass extinction. However, this mass extinction ends and disparate forms of life begin to re-populate the earth. This demonstrates that either singularities aren’t absolute and that complex adaptive systems continue in relevance despite severe setbacks.”2\nComplexity Economics in a Technological Singularity ParadigmComplexity Economics in a Technological Singularity Paradigm"

    "text": "Economic Growth\nI read conflicting views about this and tried to do a deeper dive by reading Harrawy and a textbook on Degrowth. I found the degrowth stuff quite unconvincing.\nGrumpy Economist has lots of Stuff\n\nReactionaries (Race and IQ and other things)\nhttp://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/index.html https://georgefrancis.substack.com/p/national-iq-is-the-best-predictor?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2\nActually a better one: https://thompsonj.substack.com/p/can-nations-have-iqs\n\n\nEconomic Growth in Five Figures Lant Pritchett 1\nThis has some good graphs that summarize the situation pretty thoroughly.\n\n\nThe Moral Foundations of Progress 0\nGood links to general stuff.\n“Our technological advancements used to entail new antibiotics, reductions in child mortality, and the capacity for self-determination. It is hard to compete with advances of that size, no matter how good our movies and kitchen appliances become.”\nNow they are trying to get me to join the bandwagon? “This all presents a compelling opportunity. Given its nascent state and the lack of serious full-time Progress Studies researchers, we–meaning anyone reading this document, meaning you–each have good odds of being able to substantially shape the course of this field. 25 How should we approach field-building? One approach is straightforward: publish good research, then label it Progress Studies, and simply assert that it is part of a new intellectual tradition. In contrast, my work here thus entails the beginning of an even more straightforward approach: 1. Robustly argue for foundational assumptions 2. Define operationalizations of key concepts 3. Set and enforce epistemic norms”\nQuite tempting actually.\n\n\nOur World in Data\nhas tonnes of stuff and are generally the best combination of gung-ho and data-heavy.\nSee the thread about drama with Justin Hickel for some relevant (and juicy) context.\n\n\nAgainst Wage Stagnation\nI would say that a huge amount of focus is placed on the situation in the US. There is some sense to this since they are leading the charge in GDP, but it should not be over-emphasized.\nReview\n\n\nDevelopment\nI read a lot about development. I want to organize my thoughts and my reading about this a little better.\n\n\nEconomic Growth\nAgain and again I see the idea that economic growth is good, that it drags people out of poverty, that it improves quality of life.\nMore importantly, it often seems like all the things that people want correlate with economic growth. So, even if you are unsatisfied with it as a metric for human wellbeing or happiness or anything else, finding another way of measuring what you ‘really want’ would be a waste of time because GDP already measures what you think you really want to measure. And there is already a tonne of research literature about it, so trying to create a new index and create a new body of literature on your new, improved index would be a huge waste of time.\nOf course if you can invent a wellbeing index that doesn’t correlate strongly with GDP then you will have something significant. But such a thing doesn’t seem to exist.\nHere is a good article that covers a lot of this stuff quite nicely: Economic Growth in 5 Figures.\nThere are also various things from eg. Our World in Data that cover this.\n\n\nThe issue\nThe issue is, many of my dear friends seem to disagree about this. But whenever I try to get to the heart of the disagreement, I get lost.\n\n\nCurrent work\nRead Donna Haraway’s Staying With the Trouble and try to see where the biggest points of difference between my worldview and hers are.\n\n\nOther reading\nI want to read Caliban and the Witch again, I have important disagreements with some of it. I want to read some books by Iam Morris. Though they seem to be largely things I would agree with, I want to check my methods and facts."

    "text": "Visualism\nThe director was a member of the Hollywood old-guard, a serial rapist and child molester with an excellent eye, hired by the Russians as an obligate [russian swear] against the excesses of wokeness and western decadence and diversi-rot. He had ‘never worked with a talented woman’ per his own late-night confessions in the ears of terrified assistants (especially if they happened to be female). And never intended to, apparently, if his slow progress deeper into the mire of his storied (by him) cock-and-balls’ making was any indicating.\nAnd then came Victory Star the Visualist, carried in a backpack by her keeper, a rogue Caliban of dubious broodogin (or ‘the dubious Calibrood’ as he referreed to it), who kept mostly quiet and out of the way, and carted her hither and yon without the cynical low-voiced complaints usual to his kind, though he sung almost constantly to himself in a low voice. Why she was there she would never confess to the face of the director, but between you and I, she had found a certian geometry in two of his earliest films that she intended to invoke at a few times and places in her soon-to-be storied (by others) career– uncited of course (as if that word means anything to an artist) and unacknowledged, indeed she had every intention of keeping this brief journey into the Russian steppe out of even the local newspapers, at least as far as her and her Caliban were concerned.\nNot that this hidden compliment would have wamed anthing but a twitch in the trousers of the ruined old artist who glared at her arrival with a tri-fold malevolence– female, young, genmod. (Talent, the worst crime of all, being implied by the latter two, if indeed not all three.) Said trouser-twitcher also drove a preremptory wedge between him and [Fatmanstrength] the Caliban, as he assumed (correctly) what an old european pervert assumes when he sees a strong masciform hominid carrying a delicate feminid aboutbacks, who smiles isousciantly at you on arrival, who– totally accidentally– drops a fat glob of nerve-agent salivae from a yellow poisontooth onto his dirty lapel and wipes it off, without breaking eye contact, with a hairy backhand.\nBut men will be men and the director was quicker in overcoming his competivness and instinctual terror at the grace and speed of the terrifying genmod brute. He had known such forms before, sailors and derrickmen, soldiers and other bastards he had spilled loathsome tales and Belgian beer with in Hamburg bars (before his international cancellation and removal from station and nation).\nVictory Star was a different matter. Words are not sufficient to describe what went on in the bowls, groin, chest, throat and, sometimes, even thick skull of the director during their first interactions. You would need, to accurately communicate it, at least a [pkpd] directory of the affected [sensory regions] and organs and a [x-dimensional time-series analysis of the blood], a ground-penetrating EEG (to get through the outer layers of the skull) and several hours on a cutting-edge GPU cluster. Needless to say, it was not pretty and the bluging eyes, saliva flecks gathered at the mouth-edges, yellow [???] that seemed to escape the eye-corners as if terrified of the rising blood pressure and other horrors writhing within, served to amuse Victory and set [fatman] on that iron-taste edge that kept him always subtly within striking distance or the length of a thrown rock for the first three days, which didn’t help the directors condition.\nThe radio, by which means the director had sought to escape after Victory had reached over [fatmans] shoulder and proffered her sharp little hand and announced ‘I am Mz. Star. You can call me Victory or you can call me Star. You may call me Victory Star if you insist. I will be assisting on cinematography and leading scenography as I’m certain you’re aware.’ in her high-pitched, highly articulated, rapid voice (which ejaculation itself was enough to jangle his bones and set him back a few paces, two wolves, one of horror one of fury, battling to display themselves on the inadequate space of his bloated face), was not working. Inexplicable. ‘Fucking fucking fucking fucking fuck fuckers’ he muttered darkly to himself as he walked across the mud from the comms cabin to his sleeping quarters to regroup.\nManstrength had lightened up and kept only a single ear cocked and a pebble in his pocket by day four, when shooting had started again, the director having found no way of breaking through the radio silence to demand extraction, the russian company men having lost or otherwise misplaced their satellite phones and having that russian indifference to the shouting of middle aged europeans (so much water off a ducks back)– not to mention the hesitancy with which a man who is essentially an academic with a [priaptic/tumescent] ego shouts at a former kgb (or whichever horrorshop these brick walls had been [transplanted] from) operative. The film was on, which meant to his monomanical mind only that Victory would be amused and play jolly with him, so he busied himself about whatever idle thoughts occupy the specialized and streamlined minds of those genmod bodyguard beasts when they aren’t gearing up to devour some baseform sap from back in the lineage. (On the rare occasion the director noticed him humming, never out of earshot of course, he only remembered the caution passed around about these creatures, now in their second generation and already stuff of legend. The only thing more wicked than their teeth is their idle banter. Do not ask a Caliban what is on his mind.)\nVictory, having expected this response, having done her homework with typical Victory meticuly, namely having watched the ouvre in her headscreen, resting on the shoulders of her Caliban, her great tree, her ox, as he walked across the steppes from the lake where the trans-siberian had dropped them off (she had fabulated excuses for him to the producers about not trusting helicopters, she knew he just like to walk in the mountains with his burden aboutbacks, battery packs and hunting gear and camping equipment in side satchels etc.), having read those few interviews done before the lawsuits and even a few from after, translated from the Russian state media, having prepared some small scripts for herself and means of making the story work in his fetid old mind (the director, not Manstrength whose sweet thoughts she held in deepest intimacy), rested awhile to preserve her strength, headscreen off and watching the mountains go slowly by, drinking in the base geometry of the world, the fractal flow of natural forms from smallest to greatest. She thought of the list of famous names she carried in her head, now splitting into two, a done and todo, a list of sacred shapes she still had to make, to catch and keep, hidden in other minds here and about– or sometimes she just dreamed her images, the great algorithm of her mind permuting and fabulating, reconfiguring and disassembling, reforming, deforming shapes and stories, geomitries and histories, in that manner that went back, as far as she knew, in the lineage, for a hundred years, a thousand, a hundred thousand, someplace here in caves and everywhere the world over, different snapshots of the latent space of the overmind of humanity."

    "text": "Caliban had taken Victory hunting. She took no pleasure in the gore, but she enjoyed watching him work, his clever fingers nipping strings and twisting knots, his fine motor control muscles in his forarm twitching beneath his skin. She liked the sweat on his brow as a blew on the small campfire, and the timeless, fantastic anachronism of the entire performance.\nTo the Caliban, hunting and living off the land was as much a part of his essential vocabulary as watching was to her. Every part of the world he was in, he would learn the toxic and nootropic plants, and learn where to find the nutritious or the naive. If he went a month without spending a night deep in the woods, apocalyptic nightmares would haunt his sleep. And keeping Victory safe was a rich joy in the forest, it warmed his bowels like a good meal.\nCarry me, said Victory. He lifted her with one arm and draped her across his shoulders like a pelt. She whispered in his ear. The work wasn’t going well, there were no moments in the shots, nothing new she had learned so far. She worried that the director had nothing left for her, the spark being lost in some Moscow brothel.\nNot like that, grumbled the Caliban. He was ruined from the start, the old fart. No whorehouse could take anything from him.\nThen where is it, I can’t see anything, there is nothing in the work. Victory rested her cheek on his [neck muscle] and felt its slow movements as he rearranged rocks and sticks in the fire, smelled his sweat mixed with smoke– every sensation triggering synesthetic visions, abstract shapes evolving in her head, the fold of gemoetry, shape, form and color the only algorithm her mind knew of to make sense of her sensorium. Maybe this whole journey has been for nothing.\nCaliban tutted under his breath, thick black tongue clicking against the hollow roof of his mouth. He is still scared, still tense. We still unnerve him. I will try to keep distance. He will get more used to you. Patience.\nVictory whimpered a little. This was not her favourite word, her short life being filled thus far with rapid, continuous progress. What if he was nothing for me?\nCaliban shrugged slowly, emphatically, lifting her entire body a full six inches. Now I know the Urals, he said simply.\nVictory reached a small hand around his neck and stroked his cheek with her thumb."

    "text": "But they have removed the central mystery regarding the nature of life. We can now see that all living things are made of cells: small, membrane-enclosed units filled with a concentrated aqueous solution of chemicals and endowed with the extraordinary ability to create copies of themselves by growing and then dividing in two.\n\n‘all living things are made of cells’ while interesting, is not the core mystery of life\ncell division is a candidate for a step\n\nviruses, the ubiquitous parasites that have evolved to feed on cells. Viruses are now recognized to be the most abundant biological entities on the planet.\n\npoor framing. viruses are non-cooperating replicators. they are the model for humanities continued survival\n\nThus, the parent organism hands down information specifying, in extraordinary detail, the characteristics that the offspring will have. This phenomenon of heredity is central to the definition of life: it distinguishes life from other processes, such as the growth of a crystal, or the burning of a candle, or the formation of waves on water, in which structures are generated without the same type of link between the peculiarities of parents and offspring.\n\npoor framing. the key is a product of the long-term stability of the different data-structures/information systems, and their size/complexity. a flame is a very simple but potentially long-lasting sytem. actually the chemical processes are active in all our cells, so this is hardly a counterexample, its just a macroscopic manifestation of the same chemical processes that drive life\n\nOne might not expect that they would all store their information in the same form or that the hereditary information carried by one type of cell should be readable by the information-handling machinery of another. And yet it is so. is fact pro- vides compelling evidence that all living things on Earth have inherited the form of their genetic instructions, as well as how to use them, from a universal com- mon ancestral cell. is ancestor is thought to have existed roughly 3.5–3.8 billion years ago.\n\ndoubt it lol\nbut this is remarkable no doubt. there is only ‘one way to fold a protein’. there is only ‘one way to split a cell’ ??. but there should be many ways to store the information. this does indicate a universal common ancestor– and it also indicates one of two other things: - either there is a weirdly strong evolutionary pressure to centralize the information storage method - or, life on earth is a random sample of different methods (which came in from space)\nabsent a candidate for 1, i am assuming 2\n\ne mechanisms that make life possible depend on the structure of the double-strand DNA molecule.\n\nFine, but there are tonnes of details about DNA structure which I think are largely contingent and irrelevant for my purposes.\nAnd a lot of the simplifications they make for the sake of their story of genetics are simply false, eg:\n\nthe information is always “read” in a consistent order, just as written English text is read from left to right\n\nhowever, maybe there is something significant about the double-helix. to whit: - proteins pattern-match - rna is programmable pattern matching (why? reducing the choice of amino acids stabilizes the phase space and the combinatorics) - dna is pattern-matched! this has two effects: - - it can be turned on and off - - it is more stable both of these things are crucial!\nnow, stability can be had in rna with lots of junk. but the symmetry of matching has two effects: it makes a backup of the data, and it results in the maximum stability per atom\nthis is looking strongly emergent though– different things become possible for every increase in rna length. so you just want to increase rna length and things will happen\nbut i can have my cake and eat it– the evolutionary process can be strongly emergent, but they later higher-orders of organization back-port more optimal patterns, pushing out intermediates. so long strands of RNA which evolved for stability get pushed out by DNA which does it better for less and has a second copy of the gene as a bonus.\n\nThe two strands twist around each other to form a double helix—a robust structure that can accommodate any sequence of nucleotides without altering its basic double-helical structure\n\nbut they do alter its higher-order structure!\n\nDNA is the information store for heredity, and templated polymerization is the way in which this information is copied throughout the living world.\n\ntemplated polymerization is just a fancy word for the pattern-matching i was talking about, which is the same mechanism that drives protein folding. okay in this case its a highly-complex process mediated by lots of other proteins etc. actually, it is different– otherwise you could say ‘all protein interactions are small instances of loose pattern-matching in a large network of energetic influences’. though maybe you do want to say that.\nbut if it is just a higher-order of the same– its a spreading of the markov blanket? the markov blanket of dna replication includes a lot of protiens.\nso again this is just programmable pattern matching. but wait! what does that mean? i really mean that the markov blanket is spread over a loose collection of molecules, the interactions between which are ordered on larger timescales. that is what programmable means!\nhold on– what about the argument about maths and brain states? i was grasping at the algorithm having an independent existence? but if programmable matter is just matter orchestrated (coherent over longer timescales) does that mean the math algorithm is something similar? it presumably is just brain states. but the way that different ‘math algorithm’ brain states evolve depends on different dynamics than the way that ‘language algorithm’ brain states evolve, dynamics which are encoded in a neural net. the neural net is ‘multimodal’, it has abstracted different kinds of algorithms.\n\ntwo other crucial classes of biological polymers: RNA molecules and protein molecules.\n\nrecapitulating evolution in reverse, as allways. increasingly fine-grained, increasingly many conformational states. worth noting that proteins are not arbitrary either, they collapse the space of possible chemicals to a useful set.\nthe dual use nature of RNA leads to an accounting problem, DNA solves this. this leads to better morphological stability\n\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that guide the synthesis of proteins according to the genetic instructions stored in the DNA.\n\npresumably also according to the chemical gradients in the environment– the one-to-many nature of dna transcription is critical– who mediates the number of copies produced?\nthis is just a manifestation of heredity– one-to-many! unlike RNA which are both hereditary information and product, DNA is a pure carrier, so you have abstracted away the source.\nto clarify: - strong (DNA) heredity allows long-term storage - long-term storage also allows for many copies - many copies means there is a pressure for optimization - which results in the evolution of mechanisms to control expression - in the end, fine-grained gene expression control allows for the control of morphology\n\nProteins form and maintain diverse cell and extracellular structures, generate movements, sense signals, and so on.\n\nlol, go off\n\nBut in chemistry, the term catalyst is defined more narrowly, being applied to any molecule that speeds up a specific chemical reaction without itself being changed. From the most fundamental point of view, a living cell is a self-replicating collection of catalysts that takes in food, processes this food to provide both the building blocks and energy needed to make more catalysts, and discards the materials left over as waste\n\ncool, but this is a bit like Turings ‘morphogen’ definition, maybe a bit too broad to be useful.\nI’m looking for a more concrete breakdown, something like - catalysis of chemical bonds, like ADP-ATP - stabilization of molecules, like the protein module that holds ADP in place to get catalyzed - transport of molecules, like the proteins that ferry nucleotides to the ribosome - stabilization/transport of protiens– this higher-order stabilization is harder to characterize, systems-level stuff. could be many levels. remember that DNA and other big macromolecules will eventually make up part of this structure as well\nper the definition, all of these could be called catalysts, inasmuch as they ultimately speed up the rate of catalysis?\n\nLife as an autocatalytic process. (A) The living cell is a self-replicating collection of catalysts.\n\nyou could say the same thing about morphology or heomeostatic loops, not sure how useful this is. ‘an autocatalytic process’ is also a markov blanket, finding the boundaries is still hard\n\nThese arbitrary features, it is thought, reflect frozen accidents in the early history of life.\n\nyessir. and figuring out which parts are contingent snapshots and which are inevitable is the name of the game\n\neach triplet of nucleotides, or codon\n\nthis, for example let me declare, is a topic of no importance, just striking the optimal balance between the combinatorics of the nucleotides, the stability requirements, and the number of amino acids– in other setups the tradeoff would be different, but the mechanism of the tradeoff here is not crucial, it is just finetuning.\nwhatever inefficiency there is here will be paid out via overloading\n\nAnd individual segments of the long DNA sequence are transcribed into separate mRNA molecules, coding for different proteins. Each such DNA segment represents one gene … stretches of regulatory DNA are interspersed among the segments that code for protein, and these noncoding regions bind to special protein molecules that control the rate of transcription of individual genes.\n\nnotice the contradiction here? regulatory DNA puts the lie to the idea that genes are straightforwardly expressed in stretches of DNA\nthis is important because you want to develop on your intuition for functional overloading at every opportunity\n\nLife Requires a Continual Input of Free Energy\n\nanything worth saying about this stage? should get into the jeremy england stuff, but the core idea that its all whorls on a entropy gradient is well enough etablished i think\n\nAll Cells Function as Biochemical Factories\n\nnot sure how this section differs from the previous one, its just a layer of obfuscation\n\nWithout a plasma membrane, the cell could not maintain its integrity as a coordinated chemical system.\n\nyes. the first steps of identity and selfish cooperation\nalso a convenient markov measurement stage, as well as energy-rate density. probably this is the best thing about cells– how they simplify our calculations!\n\ncells produce molecules whose chemical properties cause them to self-assemble into the structures that a cell needs.\n\nno! you got it backwards! molecules with the tendency to self-assemble produce cells\nthis is great though. where to place this? its a macroscopic manifestation of a low-level process. what is the markov blanket of a cell wall? does it have one? is a cell wall a thing? i guess there would be a coherence length to its fluctuations, maybe you can concretize the markov blanket to some moderate number of interacting phospholipids?\n\nSome of these membrane transport proteins, like some of the proteins that catalyze the fundamental small-molecule reactions inside the cell, have been so well conserved over the course of evolution that we can recognize the fam- ily resemblances between them when even the most distantly related organisms are compared.\n\ngood to know. maybe membrane transport is very high in the list\n\nThus, by specifying the RNAs and proteins that the cell produces, the genetic information recorded in the DNA sequence dictates the entire chemistry of the cell—in fact, not only its chemistry but also its form and its behavior, for these too are chiefly determined and controlled by the cell’s proteins.\n\nnope. all cells are seeded with a structure (molecular composition) which partially determines expression. you can knock an entire lineage into a different morphology without changing the DNA."

This Course I reccomend. - spend a minority of time reading stuff on alignment forum / lesswrong that you find interesting. Start building an inside model - Use the AI safety support resources: They have a newsletter, a list of resources. Furthermore, you can read JJ’s posts on “Getting started independently in AI safety” and “The application is not the applicant”. - I reccomend the https://alignmentjam.com/ hackathons if you wanna get started doing something. Might need some ML first. - General skillbuilding is great if you enjoy it. Doing supervised research or internship can be a good use of your time even if its non-alignment related. - Take care of yourself. Spend as much time on these things as you find fun/interesting/meaningful and can afford and no more :)\n\nBibliography\nTaskonomy"
