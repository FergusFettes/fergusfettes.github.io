<h1>Prologue</h1>
<p>Who could say why she chose it? In the final choosing, was it an old impulse, left in her from a long wait for pleasure in a marriage that had neither been forced nor wished, entered into only, neither resisted not sought. Or a deep contratian impulse, hidden since her school days, hardly finding a moment to escape, manifesting only in these characterful or childish moments when, in front of a screen and no-one looking over her shoulder she could express herself in small consumer choices. And did she really know the consequences? There had been advertisement campaigns and awareness raising. But who knows what people really expect. In any case, she willingy took the offer of the Affluet Utilitarians to take them off her hands, they spoke so sweetly and told her with earnest expressions she had done a good thing.</p>

<section id="section" class="level1">
<h1></h1>
<p>Xe was the most hominiform of her broodset, quite capable of ambulation and manipulation, [70° on the disability index], 3-sd outside the <em>silico</em>-mean of her genetic distribution. Xe was stood, at the moment, as she had been for some time, stock still, one hand on a tree for stability, huffing the early spring pollens. Xe had been at this for a considerable time, in a quiet corner of the summer atrium, hidden behind a [plant], she could easily have been taken for a diffuser or some other botanical-silviculturla contraption as the customers made their way through the glass halls.</p>
<p>Xe caught a distant smell and felt a memory, long hidden, of a pleasure that was great, and a pleasure that was not good. A few seeds from a plant in the cactus house, where xe did not go. A few brief memories flashed thourgh xer head– [the ecstatic, aching joy the seemed to bypass her fingertips and arrive dirctly in her groin] when she touched the sharp, poisonous barbs of the [cactus plant], and the pleasure that was not good after, when they had caught xer there, squeeking in delightful agony to herself curled up in a corner of the cactus house, one hand raised above her head, hovering over the spines, the other hand pressed between her thighs, when they had taken her roughly by the shoulders, looked her in the eye and pressed a thumb into her palm and spoke in hard sounds, the way some doctors had and made her howl. She didn’t learn many things or quickly, but she remembered the confusing emotional drama of the divine and unnerving pleasure of the great pain, and the pleasure that was not good in her keepers voices, and xe forwent the former to avoid the latter. There were pleasures apleanty in the green spaces which were good, [lileleeee!], good as the gold of the last rays or the soft belly of her best-smelling broodsib. As she stood she lingered for a rare moment [a trickle of burning oil ran down her spine] on the needles that fed her feeling fingers, on the memory of that distant day– then caught a fresh scent– the [flowers] were coming out of the ground, [earthy and thick with the smell of the soil], she must see their greentips, they must only be hours old.</p>
<p>As xe ran through the paths following the smell it grew stronger and thicker, and xer head bobbed and weaved around thick trunks of distracting scents that lay across her path to find fresh, the [rare scents] of knewly [unearthed?].</p>
<p>If xe had read XXXX xe would have XXXXX is the formula.</p>
<p>But xe hadn’t read Whitman or Lead, Dickinson or Heuysmanns, XXXX or XXX. Xe had read nary a single word as far as the doctors could tell, books blinded her (she loved them nevertheless, their [musk], their [silken pages], she kept a storied, century-old edition of <em>The Origin of Species</em> on her beadsted, a gift from a faint-hearted uncle, and the leather [tantalized her fingertips], and the mixed smell of animal and plant that filled her greedy nostrils when she ruffled the pages, old flavinoids shed from fingertips through centuries mixed with [sap and glue] were like nothing xe had ever managed to find elsewhere).</p>
<p>Even so, the sides of her mouth curled up and some pearly teeth shone through as the experiences rolled over her sensorium. And everyday xe made xer way to the gardens, despite her inability. What could drive her there, since it was not the promise of a published poem or a paper in the Journal of Botany?</p>
<p>After xer day in the botanical gardens, as xe headed home to the dormitory in the cool rafters of the Affluent Utilitarian headquarters, <em>[the sunset]</em> cheered xer cheeks for some final moments on the quiet street. Xe raced the sunset through the floors in the elevator, catching it again and again between the steel, then walked the length of the dormitory boards to start with the last rays on her back, as she performed her evening rites. She passed one by one through xer broodsibs, pitter-pattering xer fingertips down their spines, rubbing their flanks, pushing xer slender fingers through their soft har, each as pleased xer and they, huffing their pleasure at xer or pattering their paws in appreciation, before xe curled up in her cot and <em>[slept the sleep of the body]</em>.</p>
