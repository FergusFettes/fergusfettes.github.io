<p>The replacement cost<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of a human life had peaked at [price in dollars]<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and was dropping precipitously. Within one day of the announcment of the first successful births by non-human surrogates, the error bars on the prediction markets tracking human population growth had started to grow. They didn’t start converging on a new estimate for a decade, after a confused series of protests and counter-protests rocked major population centers, and a few offshore research clinics quietly speedran through the phylogenetic tree, looking for the fastest profits. Several unpopulated tropical islands capable of sustaining more than a few trophic levels were soon brimming with different wild populations of glossy stallions, cashmere goats, ankle-biters of various elite breeds. But there remains only one mammal with expected lifetime earnings consistently in the millions, and since the technique didn’t directly contravene any international moratoria, the goats soon found themselves kept company by a bevvy of bald broodlings.</p>
<p>The first generation were raised in the sort of government sterility that produced such uniquely well-adjusted individuals as Ken Kasey and Ted Kazynsky, but children are robust and the researchers had at least learned something from the unabomber. They were handed to the matronly care of some human nurses and given as many resources as their kind need to grow. When the news leaked and the children were inspected and found to be babbling merrily by the breasts of their adoptive, a few forward-thinking western nations rushed to copy them.</p>
<p>The Scottish government ran a series of funding rounds to jump-start research schools. One of the cheapest proposals came from the Scottish highlands. It only just passed review, the description being spare to the point of negligence– but since the number of international immigrants had been drying up for a few decades, and the fertility rate had hit not only shockling low levels, but the replacement population was riddled with anxiety and depression and good for little but a life of luxury, drastic measures were seen to be needed, and the bar for acceptance into the scheme was set somewhere marginally above ‘application can be successfully parsed by a competent chatbot’. The Forest Spirit Schools had corporate funding.</p>
<p>The schools consisted of little more than a dormitory in an ancient woodland, staffed entirely by indian call-center workers who fielded requests from journalists and software engineers legally registered in silicone valley<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The real work was done by The Gnomes– bulbous, archaically styled statuettes studded with sensor arrays and projectors dotted around the woodland or suspended in the air– or, more accurately, by the machine learning models that flitted<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> from server to server, looking for the cheapest compute among location-tethered jobs from more established institutions.</p>
<p>The school operated on a ‘minimum intervetion, gradual opportinuity’ basis. Any child they seemed interested was encouraged to interact with the Gnomes as much as they liked, to ask questions about the natural world around them, but questions about broader society were hedged and avoided at first. A knowledge base of mathematical, linguistic, sociological, scientific, neurological etc. ideas was available to be probed, but the examples were all illustrated using local examples and the chatbots were encouraged to abstract the rules and laws into the simples principles they could. No child in the forest shools had heart about ‘Baumols Cost Disease’ or ‘The Law of Natural Selection’ or ‘The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics’ [more diverse examples], but their intuitions were primed and tuned such that the underlying ideas were deeply intuitive to them.</p>
<p>Absent their own self-study sessions when the Gnomes would tease them and guide them in an optimal, Socratic manner, the instructible wisdom of the guadrians was kept in abeyance. The children were allowed to climb trees, fall, scream and fight, fondle and even occasionally torture one another when it was judged to be within safe limits. Before those limits were reached, subtle interventions were enacted– a child called away by a Gnome with an answer to a question the child had been probing at for days, nerd sniped casually out of a situation that might develop badly– another child might have a few phrases whispered in its ear when it seemed likely to turn down a dark path. In the unspeakably vast space of possible intervention strategies, it was impossible to know the optimal solution, but the initial choices showed promise so far beyond the hand-wringing of anxious, PTSD[^PTSD]-suffering parents that the forest schools program was expanded with new locations, new trainloads of troops to train, and increased research budget. This meant A/B testing could start in earnest, and as economies of scale grew the project and diminished the number of novel research hours required to create a happy, healthy human with broad interests, robust good health not seen since the time of the hunter-gatherers, an immune system like a brick shithouse and an eusocial attitude born of healthly living life-long with others of their kin, the replacement cost of an adult and their functional capacities hit astronomical cost-benefit ratios.</p>
<p>[^PTSD] TALK TO EMMA ABOUT ALL THIS! After I have figured out the cost of a life, and compared it to the cost of living.</p>
<p>The question on everyones lips was, what would become of these grinning machines of muscle and mania when they entered society?</p>
<p>The first thing to happen was, of course, that the market for intelligent autonomous robots crashed. The sheer pleasure and ease with which this new generation used and abused their bodies made it impossible to compete. Apartment blocks had simply to equip their facades with an interesting geometry of climbing branches and handholds<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, and food delivery services paied for themselves as gangs of prosocial athletes competed to get people what they needed as quickly and efficiently as possible, forming competing clubs that would build bridges betweeen skyscrapers, hang flying foxes and construct small parachute backpacks to make sure their members could beat out the competition. The consumers of the old guard, hiding now more and more in their virtual worlds where they could pretend to be kings, couldn’t believe their luck at first, steaming hot dim-sum delivered through their window within 5 minutes of order at a tenth of the cost they were used to. Some of them slowly started becoming cognizant of the fact that they seemed to be missing a trick, working in remote office jobs, shuffling chatbot reports between inbox and outbox while wild primates with genious iqs flung themselves haphazardly around the city outside their window. But many of them just sneered at the kids of today, as *oomers always will, and clicked ‘generate’ one more time.</p>
<p>Of course, delivery contests were not enough to entertain all the nugens, and many of them saw it as nothing more than an entertaining hobby. Many of them looked around at the strange world they had been deposited into upon reaching semi-legal majority. They had few needs, congregating as they did in carbon-fiber hammock-shelters strung between the eves of government buildings and subsisting off hand-grown vegetables and hanging plants grown by their broodsibs in the forgotten spaces around and above the cities skyscrapers<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Those nugens that wanted more started mapping the movements of crowds from their nests. A legal bug was found and quietly exploited to make desiour nugen collectives into autonomous research collectives with no legal members, which meant that they didn’t have to pass review on requests for data. They promptly starte buying up droves of cheap intersectional data from [data merchants] across the world, convolving it with data sold to them by the UKs own data representatives at [names of the uk government data brokerages], and working with that careless air of the born outlaw on deanonymizing the lot. This was not easy, the best minds of three generations having been hired into lifelong [word for feudal worker]itude by the NSA and [GCHQ??] to design and stress-test the data-sharing cryptotechniques of their respective overgovs. But with judicious application of machine learning, realtime data from mobile phone software manufacturers, civilian volunteers working for open mapping organizations and the occasional bit of low-level direct crowd manipulation (to salt the dataset with known quantities to latch onto), the eagle-eyed<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> crowd watchers of the nests managed to amass quite quickly a dataset of human behaviour rivalled only by orgs of such power that they came coupled with identical-but-for-a-detail consipiracy memetic counternetworks that kept their activity masked from all but their direct employees<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These datasets were pored over by the beady eyes and increasingly sophisticated software algorithms of the most obsessive nugen minds. If they had read Asimov, they would know what they were doing. If they had read any of the philsophers of society who watched mass movements and studied and planned their own (in Vienna at the end of the Empire). If they had had any word or term or law for what they were looking it– it would only have held them back. The only entities of this world who had some inkling of what went on in the hearts of menschen were machine learning models, and noone had gotten around to asking them the proper questions yet, busy as they were bothering the beutific minds with their prejudices.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Replacement cost revealing itself as more salient than expected lifetime value [DALY * income?] in real-world scenarios (juveniles not being legal persons making the preference easy to achieve, several court cases brought by consortia of lawyers failing to make significant headway).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>[paper about the cost to a womans career] downpayment, plus [paper about cost per year of childcare] per annum– meaning by the age of ten, the replacement cost was [cost].<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>At this point The Valley acted more and more as a purveyor of expensive vpn exit nodes for a decentralized community of staff in beach hotels and alpine resorts around the world, the streets populated by diminishing numbers of confused tourists and larger and larger populations of the walking dead, kept alive by a stead drip of tax redistributions.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Only the most recent deltas needed to be transferred, as the base and intermediate models were already cached at every major datacenter, storage costs being what they are.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>This improbable situation was prefigured by a prelude of legal acrobatics that resulted in the nugens being classified of Persons of Elevated Suspicion per the 2034 update of the Terrorist Act[Terror34], which had paved the way for different categories of legal citizen[^categories]. This meant that many of the health and saftey ordnances that had stifled European innovation for so long were bypassed (gladly) by the nugen acrobats, an accomodation they had benefitted from since birth.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>There is a lot of ruin in a nation, and there is a lot of waste of inefficiency in a city that measures its throughput in [millions of pounds per square meter annually?]. What need had they to capitalize off the solar rays striking their steel and glass buildings, or the increasingly humid air. Genmod figs made up the majority of the exostructure that crept and spread around The City, growing thick stems for the climbing and thick fruits[^wasps] for the eating. The inhabitants had already blacked out the windows generations before, preferring a floating platform in cyberspace to the vast vistas of the city.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Not literally, nugens scoring on average a mere 27/20 on standardized optometry tests, largely due to their excellent diet[citation] and countr-living[citation].

<li id="fn8"><p>Those 20-30% of the workforce who actually knew who they were working for that is, the rest being carefully [wwii los alomos term for compartmentalization?] and side-channel loaded with the errant tales from the dark web goons.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
