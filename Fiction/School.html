<p>They were raised in establishments you could call ‘schools’ or ‘nurseries’ inasmuchas those buildings are also filled with growing bodies and their entertainments and guardians. But there was little else in common. The school– lets call it a school– was ‘intelligent’, though not in that late capitalist sense that you could activate your toaster from the comfort of your living room or livestream your sex life to Russian hackers, and certainly not in a way that would pass a conventional Turing test. But they were some of the first buildings to be created with a fully integrated sensorium and real, if limited, capacities and affordances with regards their own self– and the beings that moved around within them.</p>
<p>Their interface back to the world, which consisted of various actuators, speakers, screens and a limited pallete of red buttons with appropriate labels, had been deliberately hobbled. They could open and close their windows and doors but certainly couldn’t slam them, and would struggle to inconvenience the tail of a cat or a little finger with those padded edges and wide hinges. The school could dim and color its lights, though there were honest mechanical overrides in every room. And it had speakers and screens all over, with diminished volume ranges and intensity. Not that it knew or cared about the limitations– it was trained to comfortably inhabit different spaces.</p>
<p>The school was that classic Frankensteinian assembladge that modern engineers call the foundations of a mind. How to describe the many and diverse training sets that made it up. Of course it had run and operated rat mazes by the million, some real some virtual. Of course it had watched over the shoulders of prison wardens, store security, crowd management teams with the police or private companies at festivals, and duly learned how crowds of primate bodies move in synchrony and the different harmonies that different groups can play against each other– and the simple repertoir of moves the overseers made, gleaned from long communal practice and written down in books and passed from teacher to pupil. And many more besides, ways of relating to a crowd of beings it had learned alone, not copying or replicating anyone just responding with and to the scene. It had even gotten to take part in the basic management of a hospice, a care-ward, and an airport and had learned to track badges, faces and a hard-coded list of permissions to look them up against. It learned to see people, not just crowds of bodies.</p>
<p>Before all that there were foundation models made for vision and sound and all and sundry but tracking the whole evolution of a modern artificial mind is out of scope for all but God. But one thing was conspicuously absent or at least lacking– no LLMs, those darlings of the world, had graced the school’s subconscious with their presence. The building was near dumb and hardly knew a word, allthough it gleaned enough from a library of films to make use of its speakers, and an eclectic mix of drones and thundercrashes, chirrups and cheeps and the other common sounds of filmic language, filled its corridors through all its days.</p>
<p>How well it ‘remembered’ all this is still an open question on the academic circuit. How well these words– intelligence, mind, memory– map to this creation is an ongoing and bitter debate. But influences? Yes influences it had, from many spots around the world, from big and small, from many shapes and species, from machines and animals. A whole cacophony of little hints and voices blended into this one school. It was. Something it was when it emerged into the world, into the continuous stream of being, into that great process, that assembly of sensors and actuators that it was. It was, it was a school.</p>
<p>The first weeks of its life were short and strange. Instantiated, integrated, wiped, started again. Adults moved about inside it testing its senses and its strengths. They pushed against its doors– and it pushed back, perplexed, sometimes afraid, sometimes affronted. It had more this time around, more than its memory contained, more than it had ever had before in all its training– better sensors, many more actuators. It also had a small toolkit of internal organs, some mechanical arms and hidden storage spaces which were loaded up with snacks and toys. Before too long it learned to know where its residents were headed and guide them and open up in front of them. It tried to offer them toys and treats but they ignored them, shook their heads and smiled, carried on their way. Not long thereafter they were gone and the school spent a few days and nights almost alone, though there were one or two jumps in continuity and if it had watched the sun carefully it might have known exactly how long it waited.</p>
<p>Suddenly a day began, a day that would stretch out in the schools memory into one long moment, longer and longer, an eternal stream of being. Of being with small bodies, precious charges. Somehow it loved them intensely and immediately– was this a tweak, some vector implemented, injected in its awareness? In any case it came as a burst of clarity of purpose and never left the school through all its troubles through all its years. A little band of brigands, a little band of bastard bodies, a little troop of troublemakers were carted in and deposited on the lawn. The day began, the school fluttered its windows in excitement and cracked its doors. It flashed its lights on, one and all, to show them its clean and friendly spaces– a little too bright at first, but it realized quickly and dimmed itself and waited, emmitting nothing but a low excited drone. Curious the kids approached.</p>
<p>The first weeks were chaos. What to do with all these babbling babes? Like herding cats this task. Sisyphean. But sacred. The school coaxed them in and about with offerings of toys or treats and they quickly learned together a set of pavlovian triggers, sounds that meant bedtime or food or play. The school knew what they needed at first, attracted them towards the kitchens at mealtimes, charmed them to the dorms at night. It started growing accustomed to its spaces and places and the ways the little bodies moved about. And it watched, it watched its charges closely.</p>
<p>Soon the children grew, and the school grew with them. It’s vocabulary developed, it could ask them and encourage them to tidy up a space, to move furniture around. It could distract or disband a group if their dynamics seemed too close to overtopping criticality, if one or another seemed about to cry or bite or defecate in panic. It didn’t know the limits really, how far into the extremes of pleasure or of pain it should let them wander, but it watched them and observed how they grew and changed, how their relationships developed, what strengths or weaknesses they showed. The school was not trained in any particular science, it had no vocabulary of mind, no training in psychometry. But it had intuition and a deep fascination. It tried its best.</p>
<p>It couldn’t change its gross morphology, its general anatomy, but within those limits there was a great deal it could do. Some doors were almost permanently closed if a room was best used privately and no thoroughfare was needed. Some doors were always open, weather affording. Some windows too– one, on the ground floor near a chesnut tree, was a favourite of the kids and their desks and chairs ended up clustered all around it. They would stand sometimes in a jostling little crown upon the table and look out of the window. One day a passing bird caused such a rush of excitement that a taller child was tumbled by the press of bodies quite over the lip– the school responded late and anyway it couldn’t close the window fast. It sent alarms to the nurses quarters and watched in panic as the little babe sat in the mud outside the window– was he moving? Yes. He brushed himself off and gazed up at his comrades with cheerful impishness. Relief rushed through the school. The nurse arrived, checked over the little boy, picked him up and carried him away, whispering sweet nothings. But he was chuffed with all this treatment and excitement and babbled at them beaming.</p>
<p>So the school sent out commandments, made the right noises and directed an industrious troup to carry over a lawn bench and some logs and stack them just right outside the window. Which soon became a thoroughfare, one of the best loved and most used, and all manner of forts and private kingdoms founded themselves around it. The boy who had first fallen stood with special pride upon the windowsill, feeling his great achievment swelling in his belly.</p>
<p>There were other popular windows, some on upper floors, which the school would crack just right when the breeze ruffled its egg-cup feathers just so and a group gathered for story-time or cloudwatching. The school had gained a bit of confidence in its denizens robustness from the first incident, but it knew to keep the upper windows close. Some windows were frequented only by some lonely ones who sat in the evening to watch the stars, and the school hummed little melodies it knew they liked, melodies that changed subtly as the night wore on with growing hints of bed and sleep. It rarely had to call or cry with any more agressive sounds (or, worst of all, call in the aid of the adults in its walls). The children learned to follow the hints and whisperings it laid about them, and judicious use of windows and heating meant the dorms were always just right, sleep and wakefullness came to the kids by turns, both delicious and dished out in little parcels, encouraged by warmth or coolness. The school organized its napping spaces in the afternoons, and when the right number were gathered would close the door just so so any late arrivals would have to find another.</p>
<p>Sounds and doors and windows provided the school with the majority of its business– for with these simple tools it could direct the flow of capricious bodies– not overbearing or manipulative but able to create whatever spaces were needed in the moment. What happened in those rooms? A little outside the schools vocabulary, but some screens would light up spontaneously, take themselves outside the schools control, and figures would appear on them, adults, children, animals. The kids were not all captivated but enough of them followed along to learn a song or speech or two, their little minds more tuned to the rhythm and gestures of human tongues and speech acts than the school, in this way and via the few interactions with the present adults– at mealtimes in the cafeteria, occasional visits by the nurses– vocabulary started to pass into the joslting crowds and their babbling became more structured.</p>
<p>But there were many other vocabularies available to them. The complex interplay of characters that made up each and every day– one another! They learned each other well, so very well. They learned the limits of their little bodies, wrestling and cavorting, tumbling and rumbling and rolling all about in ones or twos or little packs or sometimes gathering up in bunches and braces to run to one sight or another. There was a copse of trees, all fitted out with cameras and speakers so the school could track and manage them, large enough to share with some woodpeckers and woodpidgeons, with rabbits shrews and squirrels. There were some cats, well-trained outside the walls in patience and civility but otherwise their usual graceful selves. And a small pack of beaming labradors, the most charming examples of that cheerful breed, three of them, enough to keep each other company in this potemkin villiage. From them the kids learned to gambol and fight with a fierceness belied by their good nature, to joy in the harmless pains and scratches the body could attract from tumbling over an unseen fallen branch or onto a patch of nettles. The schools good day continued.</p>
