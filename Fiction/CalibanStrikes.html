<h1>Caliban Stikes</h1>
<p>He was at the distance limit. Who knows how many obstacles there were in the way. Some low, instinctual routine heard something which he didnt consciously identify till seconds later, the click of a metal blade. But that can’t have been all, warning signs must have been building in the background for some time, for that to trigger such a response. No matter. To business.</p>
<p>As mentioned, long before this, it started. How fast can a hominid accelerate? A typical Caliban thigh can drive [xxx]kg/m^2 of force down a shin bone. Among naked broodsibs of his, on dry earth, the had found the limits in the shear strength of the skin on the soles of the feet [xxxxkg?] and the static friction of skin on soil [xxx] and the horizontal component of the force– [xxx mpsps] of lateral acceration before the skin on the feet was expected to sheer off entirely. But he was wearing leather boots with wide rubber soles. His natural gait and crouching positing kept 55% of his body mass <em>over</em> his center of gravity, always pointing in the direction of Victory. Deep routines, isomorphic with his higher-level consciousness, triggered rapidly on stripped-back neural pathways– the muscles of his right leg were tensing at maximum capacity within [xxx]ms ([xxx] to acknowledge the trigger, [xxx] to travel the length of his lean body), long before any other parts had started to react. The secondary commands to manage acid and sugar levels would come ms later when he was already underway– for now all energy was anaerobic, and he would burn through the majority of his intramuscular ATP stock before his mass was even fully up to speed. Next, his left leg recieved slower, more nuanced commands to find firm position and start increasing tension over the next [hundreds of milliseconds] as more accurate targeting information was prepared by the [lower brain?]. After the legs, both arms got their orders, and they went through complex routines involving every muscle from shoulder to finger to simultaneously shrug off the unnecessary backpack while pulling a rod-blade out of a side pocket and reaching for the comforting mass of a small, sharp stone. Meanwhile the head was turning, aiming his eyes at the sound, and the skin from his eyebrows, his lips drawn back, round to his ears and from there down the back of his neck, his hackles, down his entire spine to the top of his rump where a tail shoud be, rose and sang with that ancient tension that meant death.</p>
<p>Within a quarter of a second, before his backpack had even hit the ground, he was at 60% of striking speed or [45??kph], his bodyweight now [75%] in front of his center of mass, falling like a terrifying surface satellite forwards, his hind leg already exerted itself on the targeting push and pulling forward to overtake the fore, his hands clasped behind his back, below his rump, in prayer, holding the slender steel and the stone betweeen them, his snarl escaped his lips now, his lips pursed, face placid as the instincts reside and his mid-order consciousness can start to take stock. A long journey ahead, the latest discussions having taken place 25 meters away, just round the corner of a caravan. His midbrain, without language but trained to mimic the higher orders with high accuracy, started looking for alternatives to the full run– ways to aim under the caravan, between the wheels, whether or not to commit to full acceleration and hope two thrown objects would remedy the situation or to take the corner at cruising speed and interface head-on with the threat. A plan, images only, to take the faster route and bounce off a tree 5 meters ahead of the expected point of visual contact, presented itself entire to the higher-order mind when it started paying attention after the entire second in which the mind had been absorbed with managing the initial response. At least half a second of total ego death had been necessary to organize the entire sensorium around the initial acceleration, but now it was underway the lofty upper reaches of consciousness could be consulted.</p>
<p>“Okay.” The mind thought, or thought it thought, or was given the indulgence of being allowed to think after the impulse had been sent into the brainstem for processing, or (more likely than not), had been told to think after the lower orders had decided for it that the plan was a good one– in any case, as the word was taking its casual and totally superfluous journey through the auditory pathways, the body carefully optimized its trajectory, watching for surface defects with the low-res rod-cell edge-processing summary of what was coming up underfoot while organizing the rest of the body to shift its arc more directly towards the mass of the tree, where his fovea was pinned. It had been decided on review that the threat was not of the absolutely highest oder, so it was decided to avoid any serious injury on contact with the tree, the legs therefore topping out at 80% of the maximum sprint speed (76mph in his case), the body mass starting to pull back from the edge of falling.</p>
<p>As he neared the edge of the caravan, less than [2.7 seconds??] after the triggersound, his body started to lean back and bunch up the organising muscles in the trunk that would control his rotation in the air. He lifted off 2 meters before the edge of the caravan, his right foot appearing around the edge first, slamming into the ground, and followed next by his elbows, both already fully engaged in throwing the stone and rod, the stone being held in the fingers, already whistling past his ear, the rod moments behind, it being reserved in case more delecate adjustments would be needed than the final spin of the fingers. By the time his eyes crested the side of the caravan, simultaneously, his body being mostly horizontal but rotating rapidly around his momentarily rotationally stationary head, his stone arm was milliseconds from maximum extension, the rod arm not far behind.</p>

<h1></h1>
<p>Meanwhile back at the ranch, the director pulled out his knife to cut angrily into a grapefruit after a particularly bitter argument with Victory, who was sitting across from him with the wide-eyed, presumptuous look that a parrot might reserve for a beetle who crawled unannounced into her breakfast bowl.</p>
<p>He was just reaching to pick up the grapefruit and raise his eyes to attempt another withering scowl when a foot appeared with a thump on the ground behind Victory and her pet beast cartwheeled through the air to land feet first with another godawful thump on the tree in front of the toilets. Somehow it hung there, both hands behind its back on the trunk, and glared with an ancient evil up at him. He suddenly reached behind his head and felt a small cut on the back of his neck, his fingers red with blood. He stood up in outrage and started yelling about wild beasts at Victory who simply said ‘I recommend you drop the knife.’ He looked stunnned at his hand and threw it down on the table as if it burned him, at which point Manstrength stepped down from the tree and pulled the steel rod out of the bark with one hand behind him. The Caliban turned and walked back the way he came, while the director yelled ‘That fucking ape threw something at me! It threw a fucking razorblade at me or something, it cut my neck, I’m lucky that fucking gorilla didn’t decapitate me.’ He said and then the shock of the fact of what he just said and how cooly Victory confirmed it with her small smile struck him in the belly, it was all he could do not to void his bowls as his legs collapsed from under him and he dropped back into his seat.</p>
<p>‘That fucking ape would have decapitated me over a grapefruit.’ He said in a small voice to himself as he stared into the beyond, heart hammering, heartbeat only beaten in ferocity by the Caliban’s, who stood only a few paces behind the caravan, recovering and listening.</p>
