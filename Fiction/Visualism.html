<h1>Visualism</h1>
<p>The director was a member of the Hollywood old-guard, a serial rapist and child molester with an excellent eye, hired by the Russians as an obligate [russian swear] against the excesses of wokeness and western decadence and diversi-rot. He had ‘never worked with a talented woman’ per his own late-night confessions in the ears of terrified assistants (especially if they happened to be female). And never intended to, apparently, if his slow progress deeper into the mire of his storied (by him) cock-and-balls’ making was any indicating.</p>
<p>And then came Victory Star the Visualist, carried in a backpack by her keeper, a rogue Caliban of dubious broodogin (or ‘the dubious Calibrood’ as he referreed to it), who kept mostly quiet and out of the way, and carted her hither and yon without the cynical low-voiced complaints usual to his kind, though he sung almost constantly to himself in a low voice. Why she was there she would never confess to the face of the director, but between you and I, she had found a certian geometry in two of his earliest films that she intended to invoke at a few times and places in her soon-to-be storied (by others) career– uncited of course (as if that word means anything to an artist) and unacknowledged, indeed she had every intention of keeping this brief journey into the Russian steppe out of even the local newspapers, at least as far as her and her Caliban were concerned.</p>
<p>Not that this hidden compliment would have wamed anthing but a twitch in the trousers of the ruined old artist who glared at her arrival with a tri-fold malevolence– female, young, genmod. (Talent, the worst crime of all, being implied by the latter two, if indeed not all three.) Said trouser-twitcher also drove a preremptory wedge between him and [Fatmanstrength] the Caliban, as he assumed (correctly) what an old european pervert assumes when he sees a strong masciform hominid carrying a delicate feminid aboutbacks, who smiles isousciantly at you on arrival, who– totally accidentally– drops a fat glob of nerve-agent salivae from a yellow poisontooth onto his dirty lapel and wipes it off, without breaking eye contact, with a hairy backhand.</p>
<p>But men will be men and the director was quicker in overcoming his competivness and instinctual terror at the grace and speed of the terrifying genmod brute. He had known such forms before, sailors and derrickmen, soldiers and other bastards he had spilled loathsome tales and Belgian beer with in Hamburg bars (before his international cancellation and removal from station and nation).</p>
<p>Victory Star was a different matter. Words are not sufficient to describe what went on in the bowls, groin, chest, throat and, sometimes, even thick skull of the director during their first interactions. You would need, to accurately communicate it, at least a [pkpd] directory of the affected [sensory regions] and organs and a [x-dimensional time-series analysis of the blood], a ground-penetrating EEG (to get through the outer layers of the skull) and several hours on a cutting-edge GPU cluster. Needless to say, it was not pretty and the bluging eyes, saliva flecks gathered at the mouth-edges, yellow [???] that seemed to escape the eye-corners as if terrified of the rising blood pressure and other horrors writhing within, served to amuse Victory and set [fatman] on that iron-taste edge that kept him always subtly within striking distance or the length of a thrown rock for the first three days, which didn’t help the directors condition.</p>
<p>The radio, by which means the director had sought to escape after Victory had reached over [fatmans] shoulder and proffered her sharp little hand and announced ‘I am Mz. Star. You can call me Victory or you can call me Star. You may call me Victory Star if you insist. I will be assisting on cinematography and leading scenography as I’m certain you’re aware.’ in her high-pitched, highly articulated, rapid voice (which ejaculation itself was enough to jangle his bones and set him back a few paces, two wolves, one of horror one of fury, battling to display themselves on the inadequate space of his bloated face), was not working. Inexplicable. ‘Fucking fucking fucking fucking fuck fuckers’ he muttered darkly to himself as he walked across the mud from the comms cabin to his sleeping quarters to regroup.</p>
<p>Manstrength had lightened up and kept only a single ear cocked and a pebble in his pocket by day four, when shooting had started again, the director having found no way of breaking through the radio silence to demand extraction, the russian company men having lost or otherwise misplaced their satellite phones and having that russian indifference to the shouting of middle aged europeans (so much water off a ducks back)– not to mention the hesitancy with which a man who is essentially an academic with a [priaptic/tumescent] ego shouts at a former kgb (or whichever horrorshop these brick walls had been [transplanted] from) operative. The film was on, which meant to his monomanical mind only that Victory would be amused and play jolly with him, so he busied himself about whatever idle thoughts occupy the specialized and streamlined minds of those genmod bodyguard beasts when they aren’t gearing up to devour some baseform sap from back in the lineage. (On the rare occasion the director noticed him humming, never out of earshot of course, he only remembered the caution passed around about these creatures, now in their second generation and already stuff of legend. <em>The only thing more wicked than their teeth is their idle banter. Do not ask a Caliban what is on his mind.</em>)</p>
<p>Victory, having expected this response, having done her homework with typical Victory meticuly, namely having watched the ouvre in her headscreen, resting on the shoulders of her Caliban, her great tree, her ox, as he walked across the steppes from the lake where the trans-siberian had dropped them off (she had fabulated excuses for him to the producers about not trusting helicopters, she knew he just like to walk in the mountains with his burden aboutbacks, battery packs and hunting gear and camping equipment in side satchels etc.), having read those few interviews done before the lawsuits and even a few from after, translated from the Russian state media, having prepared some small scripts for herself and means of making the story work in his fetid old mind (the director, not Manstrength whose sweet thoughts she held in deepest intimacy), rested awhile to preserve her strength, headscreen off and watching the mountains go slowly by, drinking in the base geometry of the world, the fractal flow of natural forms from smallest to greatest. She thought of the list of famous names she carried in her head, now splitting into two, a done and todo, a list of sacred shapes she still had to make, to catch and keep, hidden in other minds here and about– or sometimes she just dreamed her images, the great algorithm of her mind permuting and fabulating, reconfiguring and disassembling, reforming, deforming shapes and stories, geomitries and histories, in that manner that went back, as far as she knew, in the lineage, for a hundred years, a thousand, a hundred thousand, someplace here in caves and everywhere the world over, different snapshots of the latent space of the overmind of humanity.</p>
