<h1>First Visit to a Gay Sauna</h1>
<p>Glasgow, December 2025</p>
<p>Finished my last day in the office at JPMC and decided to take myself out for a treat. One of the few available saunas in Glasgow happened to be right around the corner, and on Wednesday they give free memberships. More than that in fact– when I arrived, I discovered it was 1 pound extra on the door for a drink and a bottle of poppers. 21 pounds and a name and birthday later and I was given a membership and a locker key and entry.</p>
<p>A lot of the google reviews had complained of emptiness but there were plenty of people around. I got undressed in the locker room and headed straight for the showers by the steamroom. The showers overlooked a small pool with a large television playing gay porn (what else). I showered and went into the steam room.</p>
<p>There was an older gentlemen sitting legs akimbo on the lower seat. I went up the back to the high seat in the corner and watched the room under my lids. A slightly ogrish lad that I had seen in the locker room, who had distinctly seen me, came in soon after and sat between myself and the older fellow. I let my lids fall and admired the long awaited steam with my body, lolling my head back against the hot wall and occasionally sneaking a shuttered glance at the water pooling on the tiled ceiling. The next time I lowered my gaze the two were masturbating and looking up at me. I rested some more. Then I watched them casually, the older man got up and gave himself to the younger, standing before him and letting him suckle. He put his hand on my thigh and the young man held my calf gently. I opened my eyes enough to acknowledge them then went back to my steam dreams. They left shortly after.</p>
<p>After I had taken my heat and had a shower I went to the bar. The coupon was melting in my fist and I wanted to redeem it before I settled in. The younger man was sitting at the bar, perhaps a little forlorn when I stood beside him and ordered a drink. I took in the room for a while, standing at the bar with a cocktail, but I knew I was a little exposed. There was one charming boy sitting at a table surrounded by friends, fully dressed. And a beautiful femme behind the bar, blessed with that simple femininity that doesn’t have to try. Some queens, like her at the reception, must work extra hard to outdo themselves– cursed with a jawline you could cut a rizla on, or stubble for a match. But that bartender glowed like an expecting mother.</p>
<p>I went to the stairwell and asked a staff member where I could find the sauna. Upstairs near the maze rooms. I found it and settled in. The room was lukewarm, could hardly have been over 40 degrees, so I decided to endure my way to satisfaction. A long enough stay would be almost as good as a hot one. There were two lovely old queens chatting near the door in those affectionante brogues. Of course they were talking about their bus passes and volunteering opportunities, retiree evergreens. They remarked that any attempt to wrest their passes from them would be suicide at the polls– I had to chuckle. (As we speak, pensioners are the highest earning cohort in France– the boomerocracy is paying its dividends to its favourites, and they won’t be short-changed.)</p>
<p>I took up station high in the far corner, where I could find some shelter from the constant gusts of cold air. I listened to the sweet geriatrics fondly– perhaps one day I too– no, of course not, our generation will be cut down like dogs in the meat grinder of the next industrial slaughterhouse. The long peace is ending. They had the best of it, good that someone did. I shook the dark thoughts off and went back to pleasant musings.</p>
<p>A south asian gentleman, portly, in the ripeness of middle age, came and sat beside me and molested me eagerly. He whispered compliments in my ear and offered to do me a great service with his mouth. His hand slipped between my legs and tugged gently on my flaccid organ. He went in for the kiss and whispered something conversational so I replied politely but quietly, I lowered his temperature. In fact I remarked that it doesn’t really get very hot in here, does it. Which he might have taken as it was, because he quickly started talking more loudly, about his life and work. A teacher, passing through. I asked him some questions but he fled.</p>
<p>The darlings at the door had left, but I wanted to make sure I outstayed the room. By the time the circuit was completely fresh the darlings had returned, and I decided that they would serve as my motronome– no hourglass in sight. I would wait till their second leaving. Their chatter set the room at ease, but one of them left before too long. I think the other might have been whispering to himself, I heard an undercurrent of counting or prayer, but apart from that all was silence. Two men my age sat across from me with tense presence but I avoided their gaze. But the old dear was holding fast and my heart was thumping– the cocktail was flooding my nerves with poison. I focused on my breath and took up the lotus. After a silent eternity in which, at several points, I believe I might have experienced a state of grace, the old dear departed. There was a young man across from me that I had decided to outstay– by the time he left, the room was empty except for a Latino fellow to my right, where the professor had sat. His was the first presence of the evening that did not feel like it wanted to smother me. And since the room was empty but for us, I decided to engage him in conversation. He worked and studied at the college nearby. He came here every Wednesday after the gym.</p>
<p>I left and went to the showers and a large Indian chap ambled in after me. While I was wetting my face and running my hands through my hair I felt some inquiring fingers on my member. ‘Oh. Didn’t see you there.’ I said with a forgiving smile. He told me I had beautiful testicles and toyed with them with his fingers, like a doctor. He tugged on my member but I informed him sweetly that he wouldn’t have much luck there tonight. (Or ever, as I thought.) He had that Indian penchant for humiliation, you could tell it was almost a karmic currency with him, he could drink the stuff and still smile back totally oblivious. He followed me to the TV room– ‘Just regular TV?’ I inquired. Yes he said. There is a darkroom over here he said. I thanked him but told him I had matters to attend to.</p>
<p>I walked around the building a little, poking my head briefly into the different facilities. I couldn’t quite find the place I wanted, somewhere to sit in silence and cool off. The pool had a bench next to it but there were a few boys fornicating merrily in there and they didn’t seem as self-effacing as the suitors I had had so far. The last thing I wanted was to be called out as a straight or frigid so I went back to the steam room– it has the best isolation, it is genuinly hot and insufferable, it is dank and rich and perfect. After one uneventful round I was really desperate for some cold. I saw the dears in the changing room and asked them if there was a cold shower anywhere. The helped me find one that was lukewarm and I cooled off. Then I saw a promising alleyway– it entered out into a wood-lined smoking area. Empty and perfect. I stood in the rain and watched the steam from my body mingle with the night air.</p>
<p>I did another steam round in peace and back to the smoking area. There was a sweet old man on the phone. I asked him the time and he asked if I would like a blowjob. He touched my chest respectfully as he went past and told me I was beautiful. He asked kindly if I was his type but when I smiled slowly he said it’s okay to say no and left with some soft words as a I shook my head. I respected his attempts the most, polite and interested and informed. Perhaps he would have been my type, with that attitude. In a better world.</p>
<p>Back to the steam room, passing inquiring looks and bodies. Back to the smoking area. I sat on the bench this time next to a Han Chinese fellow, perhaps with some Uigyer in him, who smoked like only the Chinese can, deep draws, at least an inch of red ember prominent against the night. After he finished he went straight in for the kiss but I evaded him and smiled and shook my head. He laughed and patted me merrily on the cock as he went past. I stood up and found the one patch of rain that wasn’t under the glare of the radiative heater and drank my fill of the Glaswegian night. What to do what to do. Since it was my first time and I knew it had only been an hour and a half or so I decided to try the sauna one more time.</p>
<p>There was a skinny man with fetching ribs sitting across from me staring into space. He was almost compelling. The room was dreadfully cool though. There was an enormous fellow in there that had taken a shining to me, who said ‘hi’ in this horrible little voice every time we passed in the corridors– I learned from him, by counterexample, what it would take to seduce me in a place like that. Indeed, from all of them. So many of the eager men go straight for the cock with an apologetic confession. I believe that the way to my heart is through my hands– if a handsome man with a magnetic presence and a six pack had taken me by the hand there’s no saying what I might do. But instead its just a parade of portly losers sighing sadly in my ear and fondling me without so much as a hello. Sad.</p>
<p>The giant never stayed long in any one place. Perhaps he thought that luck was to be found in the number of chance encounters, rather than their quality. Soon the room was empty but for two fellows who sat opposite each other. I drew my feet up and rested my head in the deepest corner and tried desperately to find some heat. The next time I opened my eyes one of them was sucking the other off. I watched them for a while beneath my lids until one invited the other to a room and they left. I felt a fondness for those two, I hope they found happiness together.</p>
<p>The room was, frankly, cold, so I decided to get my last kicks in the steam room without even cooling off. Pre-heated I didn’t last long in that final round, just watched the drops collect on the ceiling for a while and dreamed my dreams. Then I went out to the smoking area to get rid of some sweat, showered, and started getting changed.</p>
<p>My walk to the sauna had been full of dreams of the beautiful women I have loved and love, how I would dress them up and paint them with moustaches and bind their little breasts and sneak them in so I could bugger them sweetly in the dark rooms. My walk back was the same, but mixed in with brooding about the sort of paragon that might manage to interest me in a place like that. I have looked down in bliss on so many beautiful faces between my legs that the idea of a sad desperate boy looking up at me from there, at once apologetic and worshipful, stubble grazing my thighs, appeals to me not at all. And that seems to be the majority of whats on offer. I have very few treasured memories of <em>giving</em> head to pollute, so I do feel like if ever there was an adonis walking the boards in there that would invite me to give him pleasure I might be persuaded. But I don’t think I’ll come across my paragon anytime soon.</p>
<p>A fine enough sauna, almost exactly as I expected. I would prefer less tension in the air, but if a few lusty examinations and uninvited probings is all it costs, it’s a small price to pay for the existence of a sufficiently decent sauna in all the major cities of Europe– many of them available 24 hours a day. The fags have done us proud, as ever.</p>
