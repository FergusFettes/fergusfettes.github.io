<p>Watched the ending of Pantheon again. I won’t spoil it, but it got me thinking again about consciousness and experience. I want to just note down some of the thoughts I’ve had on this from time to time.</p>
<p>Lets start with the older stuff. Krishna claims in the Bhagavad Gita that he is all people, has been all people. I find it very hard to describe what this means to me. To some extent its about letting go or being able to let go of contingencies. It also helps with equanimity– ‘I would do the same in their boots’, or ‘Damn, they must be having a tough day’. It’s also easy to see how, with time, this idea could be have corrupted or modified into reincarnation, although I think that that reading is often terribly over-literal. In a way it also feels like a response to solipsism, saying no, actually, the fact that I exist is not the only thing I know– I know that a mind is a thing that can exist, I have no reason to believe there is only one of them. It implies that other people exist too, and that they are somehow like me. Schopenhauer, deeply influenced by Hindu thought, developed this idea philosophically, seeing individual minds as windows onto a single underlying Will. Instead of being trapped in individual subjectivity, we might be participating in something universal. The Hindu concept of Brahman points to something similar - the underlying unity of all consciousness and being. The individual self (Atman) is ultimately identical with this universal consciousness.</p>
<p>My understanding of UDASSA (Universal Distribution + Absolute Self Sampling Assumption) goes something like this: we can drop the assumption that we’re individuals in a world of shared experiences - instead treating every moment of consciousness as sampled from a pool of all possible experiences. I happen to be experiencing a mind that has a lifetime of memories I could mull over. Typically I suppose they are mine and I am the person that has these memories, who has lived this life. But I could also suppose that all moments of experience are independent. The idea of having had a past is just part of the character of that experience. Furthermore, when I experience a sort of ego death, when I am deep in a book or a film or even something abstract like music or code, I’m no longer this person with these memories of a lifetime, I’m just an experience instant possibly shared by many. At those times I think a bit of Dust Theory from Greg Egan– I wonder if there is a seperate timeless existence where people are sent by a particular piece of music if they experience it fully enough.</p>
<p>I think that idea can be very useful in a lot of places. For instance, the inside of a cell (particularly a cell in a body) is an environment that is kept in a particular state essentially forever. Of course there are perturbations, but they stay within defined limits (otherwise the cell dies). All cells are in this same state. Thinking of cells in this way really helps me to understand how evolution happens, how ATP synthase got so damn efficient. There are countless cells existing just now (to a first approximation), maintaining this particular universe. There have been a lot of cells in the last 3 billion years. For me it is very helpful to see the population of cells as essentially defining the size of the universe (for a specific protein, say). A very large universe will have more durable evolutionary dynamics, will afford more time to perfect the art of living there.</p>
<p>And if we are willing to be a bit more speculative we can think of human minds in this same way, as defining a specific universe. This is how I think about Egregores. It’s really hard to understand the components of a mind, because it is immaterial (neurology is not mind). This is why we have struggled to find words for it, because there are no genes, no molecules. (Even genes are just useful abstractions, they dont actually capture what happens down there.) Also the history of the mind is much shorter– that universe is much smaller– than the cellular universe. Nevertheless there must be evolution happening in that abstract space. Languages evolve in minds, that is quite apparent. But specific images and ideas– characters, archetypes, tropes etc. evolve in this universe as well. I believe my mind is a collection of egregores just as I believe my cells are a collection of proteins coded for by genes. I know very well that this is a gross oversimplification! Cells have lipids and water and all kinds of stuff, not all the proteins are made from DNA, the DNA is modified on copy, there are viruses and other complexities. Nevertheless, it is a fine enough simplification for some purposes.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I made the connections between these ideas clear enough. The idea that all people (or, going further, each instance of experience) are instances of the same mind experiencing the world through different morphologies in different times or places seems to be something of an evergreen, discovered again and again throughout history. I find it hard to really pin down what it means to me. I think that understanding the space occupied by all minds by reference to the inside of all cells captures something of its practical use as an abstraction, and helps me to think about the dynamics of what is evolving there, and how they are evolving. But this idea has meant a lot to me personally since as long as I have been aware of having a mind. I guess it makes me feel like a small part of something eternal, in a much more visceral way than cliches about stardust. Dust doesn’t experience, we do.</p>
