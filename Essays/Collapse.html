<h1>No Collapse to Mu Mind</h1>
<p>Some say that we are destined to collapse to mu mind. In my view this seems contrary to the story of biology. All is flux in the universe. This has been true and will remain true for a long time. Across all timescales, change is the law. Even on this planet, the range of environments that life is faced with covers a broad swathe of phase-space. Natures response to flux is diversity. A wide range of autonomous agents are created from the modular building blocks of the cell and the proteome. They fill the different ecological niches available to the best of their ability.</p>
<p>But agents don’t simply respond passively to the chaos around them. They also actively create environments for themselves to live in. The cell itself is an excellent example of such an environment. To a first approximation, all the cells on Earth can be thought of as a single computable environment, maintained initially by itself, then increasingly by larger and larger collections of cells acting in concert. This island of calm, an artificial island of equilibrium reproduced 10^30 times across all life on Earth, has been churning of billions of years. Within this environment, we would expect the mutual information between entities to be extraordinarily high, and for individual entities to have lost most of their identity and collapsed to some finite subset of all possible forms that provide a good enough solution to the challenges posed by all cells everywhere.</p>
<p>In short, we would expect the proteins to have collapsed to mu-mind, and we can see the extent to which they have. There is not one perfect protein that does all the work, but a modular set of proteins and many copies of each type. Seems like a partial collapse to a set of agents which together provide enough modularity to deal with whatever is thrown at them.</p>
<p>Another example would be the broader structure of multicellular animals. The benefits of a stable environment scale up naturally. Cells modularity allows them to specialize into specific types, which can then drop unnecessary components and organize into tissues. The individual cells in a muscle for example have collapsed to a local optimum. They evolved into this niche painstakingly over millions of years. The other organs in the body work to maintain a local temperature and chemical environment (nutrition, oxygen) that allows for this specialization– and the benefits are pushed into the stack, as the intracellular universe can also be further optimized.</p>
<p>Its would be easy to see the guiding agent at this scale– the self. An emergent coherent agency comes to in the brain, and looks after the body. But this happens long before true selves appear, simple animals such as worms have differentiated tissues. They are unlikely to have a true self. The collection of tissues autonomously looks after its interests, the benefits of specialization work even for a total automaton. This will be useful further up the stack.</p>
<p>Eventually selves appear. They can create more homeostasis, in a wider range of environments. Burrows and nests and inter-agent relationships (between peers and between generations) help maintain body temperatures more stably and more energy efficiently, even in the harsh conditions of eg. the arctic. And within their ecological nieches, they are again often driven to collapse down to a minimal ‘optimal’ form. We neverless still see diversity– because more forms can cover more environments more efficiently than a single form. And even when they optimize, there are often multiple local minima in morphospace– so some animals change their shape considerably with the season, or between different parts of their lifecycle.</p>
<p>It could be argued that this is all just a by-product of our circumstances– life of earth continues to exert as much stabilizing influence on its environment as it can, but the environment remains full of surprises and variety. Perhaps when we start building the Dyson sphere we will do away with all this pesky flux. It’s certainly possible that we will create stable environments on scales inconcievable to us now. But this only means that the entities maintaining those environments (and the varied optimal forms existing within it) are inconcievable to us. When people go ahead and imagine what that looks like– dissassembling the solar system to build megastructures of pure computation (for instance)– it still looks diverse. The project of turning mercury into solar panels is very different from the project of building a computation web out of the asteroid belt, is very different from siphoning off the gas giants for raw materials, is very different from populating the Oort cloud with computation. Every part of the process requires different specializations and different forms and affordances. Oh but after that! The sceptics say. After that, then we will have the still eternity! Then surely we will all collapse to mu-mind! No.&nbsp;The process continues.</p>
<p>But getting back to the matter at hand. Humans show up, and start really going to work. They use the skin of other animals as modular replacements for their own skin– now an animal can change its coat in the evening, not slowly once or twice a year! And those skins can be preserved with clever methods to last half a lifetime. A growing bounty of artefacts is being built, each of which allows for the further specialization of the form, we collapse to mu-mind again, losing affordances we don’t need, growing absurd brains and feeble bodies, some people can do little more than think. But we still don’t find the perfect form! Oh wo is me, there is still diversity! There are different cultures with different specializations, who live in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Eventually we start to pave that all over, build concrete houses with heating and air conditioning. Now, surely, at last, we can optimize ourselves in peace. We can build pods, water-immersed sensory deprivation tanks with nutrient IO via IV and catheter. Now we are getting somewhere. A lot of people at this point can start to share the important parts of the genome surely, we can polygenic screen and engineer our way to a fine enough form for floating in saline solution for a hundred years– fantastic! Progress at last, mu-mind if glimpsed– there it is, just over the horizon! Onwards gamer soldiers!</p>
<p>Oh but what are they doing in their tanks? What are all those identical forms doing with thier brilliant minds? They are building minecraft sandcastles and gooning to neuralinked superstimuli! Some of them are hooked into a video feed and their autonomic reactions are driving the creation of wild visual poems that will be fed into the commons and enjoyed by their blissed-out peers, some are doing the same for other sensory modalities. Some have dropped the sensorium and are using all their visual processing brain regions to do abstract mathematics, to optimize game architectures or archologies or economies (the difference starts to dissapear, they all feed into the same databases). And the world they are weaving together in hyperspace, it all feeds into huge banks of neural nets, which process and ponder with the human minds on the upcoming problems– now we are reading to start dissassembling mercury, now the plans are being put in place, now things are starting to move.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It’s hard to see the future. At some point we will have fully digitized minds, and we will likely be in the position to select a set of agents from all possible mind to represent us, just like the tissues of the body were selected from the space of all possible cells for their usefulness. Those minds will be able to share a lot of the same machinery, a core intellecture of the posthuman world will be specced out and built. And the probes that dissassemble mercury may well be running some number of instance of those types. This will only happen if there are larger entities at work. And those larger entities may well not be conscious, in the same way that the early animals were not. It may be that consciousness requires a very specific scale, where information can be pooled in real-time in one central workspace. I find it more likely that there will be higher forms of consciousness, consciousnesses with a cognitive integration time of weeks, months or years. Consciousnesses that are as incomprehensible to us as the moon is to a moth. Present, but so far away that the description of the distance is already incommunicable.</p>
<p>And maybe the Matrioshka brain will have a mu-mind, a slow thinking God beyond description. But just as I depend on the proclivities of my organs and depend on the good will of my cells (not to metastatize or apoptoze– the two great freedoms!) I believe they will depend on the proper functioning of all that they contain, and I hope we can be part of that, a small part of it. And I believe this is possible. And I believe that the alternative, stasis and decay on Earth, is worse. And I don’t see the possibility for a middle ground, no humans in the deep future of this lightcone, no sir.</p>
