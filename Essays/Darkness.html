<h1>Hello Darkness My Old Friend</h1>
<p>Having dark thoughts in Fes, Morocco. I will write some of them out. But I will also write out the underlying problem and what might be a solution.</p>
<section id="dark-economic-reality" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dark-economic-reality">Dark Economic Reality</h2>
<p>I can’t help but constantly be distracted by thoughts of what is the point of any of it. What are the economic realities that underly all this. I suppose it is the markets, walking through beautiful ancient alleyways full of cheap junk that noone wants. There must be some buyers, but they are more and more competing with China, Alibaba, Etsy etc. Increasingly we have systems in place to manufacture incredibly cheaply most anything we might desire. This process is only intensifying. What is left for simple manufacturing coops in Morocco? What is left of economic value for anyone to do?</p>
<p>Countries have material resources. Some people do too, but the intensification of farming also drives those profits into smaller numbers of hands. Land is also valuable, maybe the last thing that individuals in places like Fes can have that has some value. I hope the houses there are owned by individuals.</p>
<p>And of course tourism is a significant thing. But it more and more consists of providing food and accomodation, as people are less interested in trinkets. And sights, museums, tours. But I fear that without anything else to do, and not enough tourist money to go around, this just attracts the kind of desperate men that harass and drive people away. Something has to be done with them.</p>
</section>
<section id="darker-economic-realities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="darker-economic-realities">Darker Economic Realities</h2>
<p>And then I was thinking about Israel/Palestine again. There is a major flare-up ongoing there, which may end up with Gaza city razed and peremanently occupied. And I thought, what to do with the people there? Eventually they may just take in the millions who are left and make second-class citizens of them. The men can go to prison camps and the women? Well, Israel is very forward-thinking on fertility. They are working on IVF and polygenic screening. They will likely be one of the first countries to legalize and professionalize surrogacy.</p>
<p>Professionalized surrogacy in Britain would be a very chill afair. The tabloids would see to that– all the weird dynamics would be pushed into dark, secret spaces. I think it would be a good thing for everyone, people would have children again, life would return to the streets, women would be split into two classes, those free to live professional lives and surrogates. The surrogates would be lauded and treated with respect.</p>
<p>But in Israel? If they had millions of Palestinian women to put to good use? Doesn’t that seem like a recipe for something really dark?</p>
<p>And yet, economists would tell you that multi-tier citizenry could be a win-win situation. That being a second-class citizen in Israel is better than being a pseudo-first-class citizen of Egypt (or wherever the rest of the Palestinian refugees ended up). That it would also simply be the acknowledgment of the growing lived reality of many refugees in wealthy nations, where they wait endlessly for asylum and then longer for citizenship. And you could perhaps argue the same about Palestinian surrogates in Israel. In the worst case, we can imagine slumdog non-citizens being granted temporary full residency during their employ, which maybe lasts 18 months per child, to be generous. And during that time perhaps they live near the parents-to-be, or even in the same kibbutz or so. Constantly knowing that if their reporoductive facilities run out or they misstep somehow, they will be sent back to the slums.</p>
<p>But is this so different from migrant workers in any country? Chinese prostitutes in the UAE, indian labourers in Quait? And don’t I already believe that they are better off, given the opportunity to work in the manner they choose than not? Isn’t all work ultimately coercive, and that’s fine actually?</p>
</section>
<section id="section" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section">..</h2>
<p>People need some sense of purpose– or, more clearly spoken, people need to be economically valuable. Some countries have the scale to bootstrap themselves to somewhere– China, India, Indonesia etc. They can set up large enough homeostatic economic whorls that capture enough material flow that they start to draw other material flows into their orbit. But what about a smaller country, or one that is isolated, protectionist? What about Algeria or Libya, two countries I know nothing about, apart from that they are hard to get to? If they can feed their own people, then all they really need to worry about is trading for expensive medical equipment and airplane parts and things like that. Which can be expensive, but if that is all they need that can perhaps manage. But will they ever really develop from that situation? And will they be happy like that? (Could they, in fact, be happier than the young men of Morocco, faced every day with unnatainable wealth and beauty?)</p>
<p>And the people of Morocco– if their best bet is some mix of resources and tourism, doesn’t that imply that they will always be second or third tier? Just like Spain and Greece– you have to be kept poor for the tourists to visit. (But Spain and Greece are doing okay, so is Italy– maybe that part of the pack is happy enough, if there is enough wealth to go around to keep people minimally satisfied?)</p>
<p>I think a lot of the darknes comes from Landian economics. From the idea that Darwinian survival of the fittest applies at all stages and places in life. I believe this fully, inasmuch as I believe we are fully continuous with wild nature and there are no sharp boundaries between animal and human technologies (‘the birds nest is fully continuous with the iphone’). I believe we must always be in an evolutionary struggle for survival.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-solution">A Solution</h2>
<p>Well, actually that might be overselling what I know, and what I believe. I only believe that the same processes that drive nature– Nature or Natures God, Gnon– drive human civilization, and indeed each individual.</p>
<p>But do I know that that is a brutal survival of the fittest?</p>
<p>I remember reading Margulis and Harraway and wondering what they meant be neo-Darwinists. I think I understand now. They were probably talking about Landians, but not wanting to mention the dredded name. There is a paper by Margulis where she says we <em>must</em> overcome Darwin. I thought this was brave and bold, but ultimately fruitless at the time.</p>
<p>But then I discovered Levin and Jung. These two names may seem like a strange pair, but they are probably the best referents for what I’m starting to believe. There is a YouTube series from a channel which, when I clicked over to it from a link shared on Twitter by Levin had 98 subscribers (soon 99). It proposed a new theory of everything.</p>
<p>Of course, I have been looking for and experimenting with theories of everything for a while. I think the World as a Neural Net, World as a Learning Process people and the Active Inference, Minimizing Surprize, Minimizing Prediction Error people are getting at the same thing. Jung and Levin approach the same material from two different but more approachable angles. Jung from the angle of mind, Levin from the angle of Body.</p>
<p>All together, they build up a picture of evolutionary processes that are not just mutate, kill, mate, survive. But a collaborative, self-creating process that communicates and drives itself across all levels of the evolutionary scale. It may be the case they Darwin was Wrong. And this would be a wonderful thing.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-if-darwin-was-wrong" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-if-darwin-was-wrong">What if Darwin Was Wrong?</h2>
<p>If Darwin was Wrong, we are not forced to live in a world dominated by competition for survival and/or malthusian relaxation and decay. If Darwin was wrong, Land can be wrong too.</p>
<p>None of this really explains to me how the people of Morocco can suddenly make themselves significant players on the world economy. Leveraging their tourism and their resources more, investing more in education, making sure all children have access to the internet and know about things like Khan Academy and are motivated to take part in it would be a start. (On this subject, I’m looking forward to seeing what the children of India make of their infinite internet resources– hopefully something? Surely?) I think every country has to take part in the growing digital economy as well, and they can because all it takes is smarts and will. And people everywhere have that, but it needs to be cultivated carefully from birth to flourish at its best.</p>
<p>The thing is, it is clear that somewhere like China that manages the value creation from a large part of the worlds resources is winning. But most of their winning came from the work of their people, and their people won’t want to work like that forever. And once the factories become automated, those lower-to-middle classes that worked their ways in factories out of poverty won’t have much to do either– and the factories will make no profits, because factories never do, they are always driven to the slimmest margins. But by then the young of China will be being raised truly internet-native and canny in the ways of the world, and they will make themselves relevant.</p>
<p>Will it still be possible to make that transformation, in a time of near full-automation? I don’t know. But I do believe, strange as it may sound, that a deeper and more nuanced understanding of biology and evolution and Gnon can help me have hope and a better understanding of what that might look like.</p>
