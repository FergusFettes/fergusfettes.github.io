<p>The title of this section is a joke, due to this unfortunate interaction</p>
<p>[whatsapp-python-developer][image]</p>
<p>which lead to one of the most thoroughgoing dressing-downs I have ever recieved from someone ten years my junior. It was in one of my wilder summers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> when I was frequenting the afterparies of Impulstanz Festival in Vienna. The individual with whom I had been texting told me with an intense and terrifying mix of fondness and fury that that was not a good response to a question about what one does– not a good way of continuing a conversation. To give you a flavour of her assaults, near the end of the evening she was getting into a taxi mid-rant and pointed at a friend who knew the address of the next location and then at us saying ‘these motherfuckers are coming to the afterparty’ without a trace of delicacy. Presumably we were coming there for a grilling.</p>
<p>In any case, I do indeed program computers. And while I nominally do so using python, I am also increasingly comfortable with bash, with markdown, with SQL[^Postgres– see my <a href="Misc/Tips">tips</a> folder.], and with those weird pseudo-DSLs that are basically glorified config files– I’m basically talking about YAML of course– that constitute much of the ‘DevOps’ lifecycle. I also, though I am not proud of this, occasionally click my way through a maze of AWS screens, though I prefer to do that sort of thing in terraform when I can (or bash).</p>
<section id="ondewo" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ondewo">ONDEWO</h3>
<p>Once I got home from India, I was working on my parents farm, utterly destitute again, not a penny to my name. I applied for many jobs, and I got an interview for one. The programming task seemed quite challenging. With hindsight, it was totally unreasonable– my boss later told me that he had since tried useding it on other people and noone else ever managed to submit anything. I was given a week to finish it, and I worked on it 20-some hours a day (by the end ceasing to sleep entirely) until I had cracked it sufficiently well to submit it.</p>
<p>I got the job and moved to Austria. My first month was quite intense, it was clear I was underqualified so I worked myself to the bone, while also needing to spend much of my evenings entertaining couch surfing hosts and shmoozing at art fairs in order to find a home– I didn’t have enough money to pay rent until I got my first paycheck. One of my coworkers took me in for a week, and I found a flat through a friend, where I didn’t have to pay till the next month.</p>
<section id="history" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="history">History</h4>
<p>Wow, what a place! This was my first job as an actual software engineer, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity, the experience, and for setting a low bar for all my future bosses to rise above!</p>
<p>I need to address that first. The boss at ONDEWO was quite the man. He was credentialled, hard-working, and determined. He was also really quite talented at finding talent! The team, when I arrived, was quite cool, lots of very intelligent people doing interesting work. And he chose a solid problem to work on. I really believe it could have all worked out actually, and he could have had his dream of being an Austrian Unicorn. Alas! It was not to be! Sometimes my heart bleeds a little for him.</p>
<p>But for the little, really quite tiny, microscopic even, cracks in the edifice. It was not all right. In fact it was quite wrong, and the subtle ways in which if failed to obtain, again and again, showed through– the cracks widened– the edifice crubled. All that really happened was, he was not straightforward. All that happened was, he treated his employees to the smae bullshit that he treated prospective customers. He was fundamentally, achingly dishonest, hard to trust or to like, and his manipulations were too obvious (and therefore odious). I think if he had been more direct and open with his employees, if he had managed to ‘turn off’ his modus operandi every now and then and communicate with us individually, with anyone, it could have worked. But I don’t think anyone got through to him.</p>
<p>The classic story happened. One of his highest-up quit, and over the next two years so did everyone else. It was very obvious what was happening, as it was happening. The entire drama played out with that deeply moving sense of historical inevitability– you felt like you were watching one of the great dramas, a tragicomedy.</p>
<p>There isn’t much more to say on the timelines. I worked incrdibly hard, I don’t know how much if I include all the evenings reading blogs and tutorials on the internet. Fully 50 hours a week in the office, but and extra 10-30 a week of reading I suspect. There was a time when I was also coding on the weekends, but I started getting muscle cramps in my forearms, and thankfully noticed and stopped in time. In fact I spent some weeks trying not to use my arms at all when I was not at work, there were strange motions under the surface, my muscles were not happy, and I am very thankful that I am blessed with enough <a href="W!">proprioception</a> to notice this soon enough to manage it.</p>

<p>I was a python developer. But my first task was quite out there. I had to wrestle with a huge, old python2 library, and try to turn it into something useable.</p>

<p>I am currently working in a tech startup that is working in the vehicle automation space. We would probably like to one day make self-driving trucks– but in the meantime<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> we are working on AI-powered advanced cruise control for making truckers lives more comfortable and more energy efficient– and more interestingly (and more immediately for myself personally) providing a large amount of data for use to learn from, train on, and generally play with.</p>
