<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-babies-walk-not-just-swim-an-overview-of-gestation-strategies">Making Babies Walk, Not Just Swim: An Overview of Gestation Strategies</h2>
<p>The cost of reading DNA has fallen four orders of magnitude in twenty years; the cost of <em>using</em> a uterus has not. While Gwern’s “Whence the Genes?” asks how to choose the best variants once they are already in a dish, this companion piece asks how that dish—or pig, or machine—gets the finished product to the finish line of live birth. The same Moore’s-law curve that gave us $28 SNP chips is now giving us $2,000 uterus transplants, 0.3 mm artificial-placenta oxygenators, and CRISPR pigs whose endometrium expresses human HLA-G. The gestational layer is becoming modular.</p>
<p>Below we review the four modular slots that replace or improve the ancestral workflow: (A) keep the womb but upgrade it; (B) rent another woman’s; (C) subcontract to a bioreactor; (D) repurpose a non-human uterus. For each slot we sketch current cost, technical readiness, and the crude expected burden of proof for safety. We defer detailed cost-benefit calculations to later sections.</p>

<section id="a.-keep-it-in-house" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-keep-it-in-house">A. Keep-It-In-House</h2>
<p>Natural pregnancy begins with an embryo that burrows into the lining of its mother’s uterus and stays there for forty weeks, drawing oxygen and nutrients through a disk-shaped organ—the placenta—until the cervix dilates and the infant squeezes through the bony birth canal. That sequence is the evolutionary default and still accounts for the majority of deliveries worldwide. Within this default, medicine already offers one ancient tweak: the Caesarean section, a surgical detour that trades labour pain and pelvic trauma for a fifteen-centimet abdominal incision and a six-week recovery. Because the uterus itself is left in place, C-sections can be repeated two or three times before the accumulating scar tissue raises the risk of abnormal placentation; nevertheless, the procedure is now used for roughly one in three deliveries in many high-income countries and for more than half in parts of Latin America and China.</p>
<p>For women who lack a uterus (congenital absence, post-hysterectomy, or severe endometrial damage) but want the genetic child rather than a surrogate, the next rung is uterus transplantation: a deceased or living donor organ is sewn into the recipient’s pelvis, immunosuppression is maintained for one or two pregnancies, and the graft is removed or allowed to involute once childbearing is complete. The first live birth was reported in Sweden in 2014; roughly a hundred children have since been delivered from transplanted uteri, with graft survival approaching 70% at five years. The surgery is expensive—about US$60,000 in the few centres that quote cash prices—and limited by donor supply, but it keeps the entire gestational labour inside the biological mother’s body, satisfying both legal parentage requirements and, for some patients, a strong psychological preference.</p>
<p>Editing can be aimed at either generation. One path is to edit the future mother herself: widen the pelvic inlet, loosen connective-tissue laxity, or increase uterine blood flow—traits already variable in ordinary populations and controlled by well-mapped loci such as HOXA11 and TBX4. Because the edits would be introduced in infancy or early puberty, the benefit compounds over decades and applies to every pregnancy that woman will ever carry, effectively amortising the one-time intervention across her reproductive life. Alternatively, the embryo—rather than the mother—can be selected or edited for alleles that reduce birthweight by a few hundred grams without touching brain growth genes, lowering the risk of cephalopelvic disproportion and thus of emergency Caesarean. The first approach raises fewer safety flags (the edits are not heritable if performed somatically) but requires societal willingness to edit healthy children; the second avoids germline edits to adults yet must be repeated for every conception.</p>
<p>Finally, Category A includes an escape hatch that stops short of full ectogenesis: elective delivery at 24–28 weeks followed by neonatal intensive care. Survival at 24 weeks now exceeds 70% in experienced units, and disability-free survival is close to 60%, but the price is a month-long NICU stay costing roughly US$250,000 and a small but measurable increase in long-term neurodevelopmental risk. We list it here because the first two trimesters still occur in the mother’s own womb; the details of complete artificial support will reappear under Category C.</p>

<section id="b.-human-surrogacy-renting-womb-time" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-human-surrogacy-renting-womb-time">B. Human Surrogacy: Renting Womb-Time</h2>
<p>When the intending parents cannot—or prefer not to—carry, the simplest swap is another woman’s uterus. The legal scaffolding is already in place in much of the world: a contract designates a “gestational carrier” who receives an embryo created from the parents’ egg and sperm (or donor gametes) and relinquishes the child at birth. Medical protocol is indistinguishable from ordinary IVF: hormonal preparation of the endometrium, single embryo transfer, prenatal care, and delivery either vaginally or by planned Caesarean. What is traded is not technology but labour, risk, and liability.</p>
<p>Traditional surrogacy (carrier also provides the egg) is now rare because the genetic link clouds custody law; almost all commercial arrangements are gestational-only. In the United States—where commercial surrogacy is most transparent—a typical package costs US$90,000–120,000 all-in, of which roughly one-third compensates the carrier for nine months of service, two-thirds covers agency, legal, medical, and insurance overhead. Live-birth rates per transferred embryo mirror standard IVF (~45% for women under 35), so single-baby deliveries are the norm; twin transfers are discouraged because obstetric complications scale exponentially.</p>
<p>Screening is the quiet revolution. Agencies already reject carriers with diabetes, hypertension, or previous pre-eclampsia; the next step is polygenic screening for those same traits plus uterine artery resistance, cervical insufficiency, and postpartum haemorrhage risk. A high-risk score is not a legal bar, but it lowers a candidate’s market price and pushes intended parents toward a different carrier—soft eugenics via informed shoppers rather than regulation.</p>
<p>Looking forward, one can imagine an agency advertising “edited carriers”: young women who, as embryos themselves, were CRISPR-edited for wider pelvises, higher uterine blood-flow variants, and blunted stress reactivity. Such women would still be surrogates, but their bodies would be statistically better at the job and might command a wage premium. The edits would improve their own health, yet they would be passed on only if the professional surrogates later chose to have their own biological children; otherwise the alleles disappear when their ovaries are never used.</p>
</section>
<section id="c.-ectogenesis-replacing-the-womb-with-a-box" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-ectogenesis-replacing-the-womb-with-a-box">C. Ectogenesis: Replacing the Womb with a Box</h2>
<p>If human surrogacy is the labour-market fix, ectogenesis is the capital-goods fix: an external appliance that keeps a conceptus alive from fertilisation to neonatal weight ≥2 kg. No one has yet run a human from day 0 to 37 weeks outside a body, but goat fetuses have passed the 24-week human-equivalent mark in a fluid circuit lined with a microfluidic oxygenator. The hard limit is shear stress: a 20-week human placenta needs to deliver ~0.4 ml O₂/min through an interface that cannot exceed 200 dyn/cm² without stripping the chorion. Current hollow-fibre cartridges borrowed from paediatric ECMO can keep fetuses alive for ~70 h; the next increment is a villous-membrane bioreactor that buys weeks, not hours.</p>
<p>Planned iatrogenic prematurity will never clear ethics boards until its safety curve sits directly on top of term birth. The shortest path to parity is not merely better incubators but better babies. Polygenic scores already explain ~15% of the variance in neonatal lung maturity (surfactant protein B, SFTPB) and ~10% of retinal vascular resilience. Selecting—or editing—those high-score alleles into the embryo lowers the risk of chronic lung disease and retinopathy of prematurity without touching brain volume. A complementary edit targets adrenal regulation: up-regulate the enzymes that produce cortisol precursors so that the fetus can mount a mature post-natal stress response at 24 weeks rather than 30. Early mouse data show a 40% drop in cerebral palsy–like pathology after induced premature delivery when both pathways are boosted. Taken together, “ecto-optimized” embryos could move the survival-without-major-morbidity curve from its current 70% at 24 weeks to the mid-90s, the historical territory of 32-week infants. Once that threshold is reached, the ethical objection collapses: planned 24-week extraction becomes a lifestyle Caesarean at a smaller scale.</p>
<p>Partial ectogenesis is therefore the first commercial product: elective delivery at 24–25 weeks followed by a short NICU bridge. Full ectogenesis still needs two additional breakthroughs: (1) extending the legal embryo culture limit beyond 14 days to allow the heart to autonomously perfuse the oxygenator and (2) an anticoagulation protocol that prevents thrombosis in the single umbilical arteriovenous loop for at least four weeks. Both are engineering problems with known physics; neither requires new biology. If lung-maturity edits are bundled into every embryo intended for early delivery, the residual morbidity becomes low enough that insurers could price the procedure at a premium comparable to upscale surrogacy, not catastrophic care.</p>
<p>D. Xenosurrogacy: borrowing a womb from another species</p>
<p>Xenosurrogacy is the straightforward idea that if a human uterus is unavailable or politically expensive, another mammal’s uterus might do the gestational work. It sits between human surrogacy (same biology, scarce labour) and ectogenesis (different biology, scarce technology): you keep a living placenta and endocrine environment, but you outsource them to livestock. Among candidates, pigs and horses dominate for practical reasons. They are large, familiar, manageable, and already bred at scale; their pregnancies are measured in months; and veterinary obstetrics for both species is a mature craft.</p>
<p>Two constraints govern the design space: immunology and obstetrics. Immunology asks whether the maternal lining will tolerate a human placenta long enough to finish the job; progress in xenotransplantation suggests compatibility can be engineered at the maternal–fetal interface, but it still implies rigorous screening and containment to manage infection risk. Obstetrics asks whether, by the time the fetus is ready to leave, its head and shoulders can safely pass the host’s birth canal—or whether you must deliver surgically. Because a human fetus grows larger than most litters and differently shaped than most neonates, the safe window tends to be preterm by human standards, with a short neonatal-ICU bridge afterward. Xenosurrogacy is thus best viewed as a hybrid with partial ectogenesis, not a complete replacement for it.</p>
<p>Pigs. Sows carry many fetuses and “decide” when to deliver based on overall fetal load, not a singleton’s timetable. That makes them attractive for high-throughput: in principle, you can implant several human embryos and aim to bring all of them to a consistent preterm age, maximizing live births per pregnancy without any fetal reduction. The tradeoff is crowding. Multiple placentas must share the same uterine blood supply, so the risks are uneven growth and earlier spontaneous labour. You mitigate by keeping individual target birthweights modest (still within normal human variance) and by selecting embryos with better tolerance for preterm life—lungs, retina, and stress response—so that earlier delivery carries less penalty. Delivery method is a choice: induced vaginal birth is simpler and gentler on the host; a surgical delivery remains a backup when positioning, bleeding, or neonatal resuscitation make it safer. Result: several premature but viable infants per pregnancy, each requiring a predictable NICU stay.</p>
<p>Horses. Mares tend to carry singletons and deliver larger neonates through a wider canal. That buys extra headroom on timing: you can aim later than with pigs and still expect a vaginal delivery. The price is a tougher immunological fit and lower per-pregnancy throughput; with fewer embryos sharing space, you expect larger, more mature infants but not litter-sized numbers. For regulators and publics that prefer “one pregnancy, a handful of babies, no surgical reduction,” the horse profile is easier to explain—fewer ethical tripwires, more room at the exit, and routine veterinary induction protocols already in use.</p>
<p>Across both hosts, three cross-cutting points matter more than species trivia: - Safety parity is the bar. Planned prematurity will not be acceptable unless outcomes converge on ordinary human births; that pushes the program toward conservative gestational ages, strong NICU partnerships, stringent pathogen controls, and—if permitted—embryo selection for traits that specifically reduce prematurity complications without touching brain growth. - Animal welfare is a first-order constraint. Even if the biology works, housing, handling, and recovery must look like best-in-class veterinary care, or the entire approach will be socially non-viable. - Law and logistics will shape the technology. Jurisdictions will differ on whether a human born from livestock is a citizen at birth, what standards of consent apply, and how parentage is recorded. Those choices determine whether xenosurrogacy becomes an edge-case medical rescue or a routine service.</p>
<p>In short, pigs offer scale and efficiency at earlier gestational ages; horses offer more comfortable exits at slightly later ages with smaller cohorts. Neither path eliminates the need for neonatal support, and both require careful biosecurity and oversight. But as a way to convert engineering and animal husbandry into human gestational capacity, xenosurrogacy is the most “off-the-shelf” alternative to human wombs we are likely to have before full artificial wombs arrive.</p>
