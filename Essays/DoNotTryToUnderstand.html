<h1>Do Not Try To Understand</h1>
<p>The tongue-in-cheek cosmogony described by Douglas Adams in the Hitchhikers Guide has been worming its way around my thoughts for some weeks now. I am coming to believe that it was startlingly prescient. That theory is discussed in <a href="#sec-2">Section&nbsp;1.2</a>, but first a little background on ideas.</p>
<section id="mental-health" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mental-health">1: Mental Health</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Where others have carved their numbers, and Alberto and I our names, Clausner has written: <em>‘Ne pas chercher a comprendre.’</em><br>
~<strong>Levi</strong>, <em>If This Be a Man (1947)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This moment, experienced second-hand by an Italian Chemist in a concentration camp, was not the first time someone shied away from an idea for the sake of their own health.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Schopenhauer already knew that thought is medically disastrous, Nietzsche demonstrated it.<br>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>In ‘The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind’ Julian Jaynes describes the theory that the event we<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> experienced as the original ‘fall from grace’ was the seperating of the mind from the body, some 4-6kya<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Since then we have been driven by a strange, double engine: the ancient life of our wet biochemistry, and the fire of our demonology.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;At least Europeans, Arabs and Asians, culturally speaking, have some number of shared mythological roots there.</p></li><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;“This strange and, I think, spurious idea of a lost innocence takes its mark precisely in the breakdown of the bicameral mind as the first great conscious narratization of mankind. It is the song of the Assyrian psalms, the wail of the Hebrew hymns, the myth of Eden, the fundamental fall from divine favor that is the source and first premise of the world’s great religions. I interpret this hypothetical fall of man to be the groping of newly conscious men to narratize what has happened to them, the loss of divine voices and assurances in a chaos of human directive and selfish privacies.”</p></li><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Jaynes actually discusses two possibilities– very recent, and extremely recent ‘evolution’ (likely by ‘cultural selection’ aka genocide). The very recent (10kya) version seems to be getting some support, if I am reading <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.05.525539v1">this paper</a> properly: a peak in genetic polymorphism in the lask 60ky, being filtered down to relatively low rates of polymorphism ~10kya.</p></li></div></div>
<p>What is interesting about the theory is not just what it says about our consciousness, but what it says about the consciousness that came before:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>The bicameral mind.</em> The second main hypothesis is that preceding consciousness there was a different mentality based on verbal hallucinations.<br>
~<strong>Jaynes</strong>, <em>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (1976)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The image is of a mind that is fused with the body, with no distinction between the two:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is also no concept of will or word for it, the concept developing curiously late in Greek thought. Thus, Iliadic men have no will of their own and certainly no notion of free will. ~Ibid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea, not fully developed by Jaynes, was spelled out in merciless detail by a science fiction author in the 90s:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Asherah worship continued in many places, though. It was an incredibly tenacious cult, a throwback to Sumer, that spread itself both verbally and through the exchange of bodily fluids – they had cult prostitutes, and they also adopted orphans and spread the virus to them via breast milk.”<br>
“Wait a minute,” Ng says. “Now you are talking about a biological virus again.”<br>
“Exactly. That’s the whole point of Asherah. It’s both. As an example, look at herpes simplex. Herpes heads straight for the nervous system when it enters the body. Some strains stay in the peripheral nervous system, but other strains head like a bullet for the central nervous system and take up permanent residence in the cells of the brain – coiling around the brainstem like a serpent around a tree. The Asherah virus, which may be related to herpes, or they may be one and the same, passes through the cell walls and goes to the nucleus and messes with the cell’s DNA…”<br>
“And when it alters that DNA, what is the result?”<br>
“I would guess that it also tends to encourage irrational behavior, maybe lowers the victim’s defenses to viral ideas, makes them sexually promiscuous, perhaps all of the above.”<br>
“Does every viral idea have a biological virus counterpart?” Uncle Enzo says.<br>
“No.&nbsp;Only Asherah does, as far as I know. That is why, of all the men and all the gods and religious practices that predominated in Sumer, only Asherah is still going strong today. A viral idea can be stamped out – as happened with Nazism, bell bottoms, and Bart Simpson T-shirts – but Asherah, because it has a biological aspect, can remain latent in the human body. After Babel, Asherah was still resident in the human brain, being passed on from mother to child and from lover to lover.”<br>
~<strong>Stephenson</strong>, <em>Snow Crash (1992)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Stephenson is taking some liberties with Jaynes’ idea and expanding it as only a sci-fi author can. It should be taken with a pinch of salt– but it should be taken! There are many more discussions of this topic in the book.</p>
<p>To put it simply, it is only the idea that <strong>magic is afoot</strong>– that spells and incantations are real, that psychosomatic effects are stronger and more resilient than many people like to believe, and moreover are crucially bi-directional in a very real way. (Whether they are as real as Asherah is a valid question– but real.)</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen this idea spelled out like this again, until I read the following lines in a Nick Land book:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An aged philosopher is either a monster of stamina or a charlatan. How long does it take to be wasted by a fire-storm? By an artificial sun upon the earth? It is only when the blaze in Nietzsche’s brain-stem fused with the one in the sky above a piazza in Turin that libidinal materialism touched upon its realization.<br>
~<strong>Land</strong>, <em>The Thirst for Annihilation (1992)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>And I would caution anyone who thinks this is an exaggeration– Nick Land is, by many accounts, no longer of this world. Some say he is insane, some say he is just a miserable old racist on twitter, in any case something strange<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> happened to his mind, some part of that blazing fire seems to have scarred his brainstem.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;I’m not going to steelman racism here, but you could make the claim that, in this world, being racist is hardly strange. True, but what I find strange is the idea that someone who said “Since I have floated in death the world has desisted from all effort to seduce me into seriousness. I rest in life as a tramp rests in a hedge, mumbling these words…” would find any reason to spend years making deranged jokes on twitter. <strong><em>ne pas chercher a comprendre, ne pas chercher a comprendre…</em></strong></p></li></div></div>

<p>I am an AI Worrier. Beyond that I won’t make commitments (I still don’t know the meaning of ‘alignment’, still skeptical and searching). One part of my worry is wrapped up in this funny little cosmogony by an English comedy-sci-fi author. They set the machine running:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“All I wanted to say,” bellowed the computer, “is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything–” he paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone’s attention, before continuing more quietly, “but the programme will take me a little while to run.” ~Ibid., <em>The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galazy (1979)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and prepare to wait for the response. The answer arrives– you know this part:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“You’re really not going to like it,” observed Deep Thought.<br>
“But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!” howled Loonquawl.<br>
“I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.” ~Ibid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then, the search for the question begins:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Look, alright, alright,” said Loonquawl, “can you just please tell us the Question?”<br>
“No, but I’ll tell you who can,” said Deep Thought.<br>
“I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me,” intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. “A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate – and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called… The Earth.” ~Ibid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only thing wrong about this is the timescale. <code>10e6</code> years– who’s counting that? We have different questions running in different timeframes, I’m not familiar with that one.</p>

<section id="sec-catholicism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-catholicism">The Great Question at the Heart of Catholicism</h3>
<p>Whatever this question was, in our secular world it seems to have been answered. In <a href="https://genius.com/Nick-land-shamanic-nietzsche-annotated">Shamanic Neitzsche</a> Nick Land describes this process with characteristic vigour:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Will Christendom ever reap the whirlwind it has sown? That it should try to pass, without the vulnerability of interval, from a tyranny to a joke, is certainly understandable, but that its enemies should do nothing to obstruct its evasion of nemesis is more puzzling. How can there be such indifference to the decline of our inquisitors? Is it that they succeed so exorbitantly in their project of domestication that we have been robbed of every impulse to bite back? Having at last escaped from the torture-palace of authoritarian love we shuffle about, numb and confused, flinching from the twisted septic wound of our past (now clumsily bandaged with the rags of secular culture). It is painfully evident that post-christian humanity is a pack of broken dogs.<br>
…<br>
A despot abandons any game that begins to turn out badly. This has been the case with metaphysics. From Kant onwards exploratory philosophy ceased to generate the outcomes favourable to established (theistic) power, and we were suddenly told: “this game is over, let’s call it a draw”. The authoritarian tradition of European reason tried to pull the plug on the great voyages at exactly the point they first became interesting, which is to say: atheistic, inhuman, experimental, and dangerous. Schopenhauer – refusing the agnostic stand-off of antinomy – was the first rallying zone for all those disgusted by the contrived peace entitled ‘the end of metaphysics’.<br>
~<strong>Land</strong>, <em>Shamanic Nietzsche</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The line “exploratory philosophy ceased to generate the outcomes favourable to established (theistic) power, and we were suddenly told: <strong>“this game is over, let’s call it a draw”</strong>.” is the message within the vitriol. Is this true? Lets take it as a possibility, and a dark hint for other questions.</p>

For better or worse, much of Hegel’s historicism has become part of our contemporary intellectual baggage. The notion that mankind has progressed through a series of primitive stages of consciousness on his path to the present, and that these stages corresponded to concrete forms of social organization, such as tribal, slave-owning, theocratic, and finally democratic-egalitarian societies, has become inseparable from the modern understanding of man.<br>

<p>I often worry about medical science, and the shortcuts they take to try to find easy solutions. I think almost all approaches that depend fundamentally on animal or human experimentation are doomed to failure. Certainly you need such models in the final stretch to sanity-check results and safety, but a medicine built on this kind of butchery can’t be good.</p>

<p>Ōdī et amō. Quārē id faciam fortasse requīris. Nesciŏ, sed fierī sentiō et excrucior.<br>

I hate and I love. Why I do this, perhaps you ask. I know not, but I feel it happening and I am tortured.<br>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-of-the-question">The Problem of the Question</h3>
<p>The problem is, as the examples above may help to illustrate– what happens when you find the answer? What happens to the question?</p>
<p><strong>I am struck with an immense and growing fear that the answer and the question will always annihilate one another.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Catholicism:<br>
“It is painfully evident that post-christian humanity is a pack of broken dogs.” ~Land, <em>Shamanic Nietzsche</em></li>
<li>Western Civilization:<br>
“The end of history will be a very sad time. The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one’s life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands. In the post-historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history. I can feel in myself, and see in others around me, a powerful nostalgia for the time when history existed. Such nostalgia, in fact, will continue to fuel competition and conflict even in the post-historical world for some time to come. Even though I recognize its inevitability, I have the most ambivalent feelings for the civilization that has been created in Europe since 1945, with its north Atlantic and Asian offshoots. Perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once again.” ~Fukuyama <em>The End of History?</em></li>
<li>The Great Question of Myself: this is explicitely the idea of The Word</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the question of Medicine. Let us say that Levin started his career with the simple goal of trying to do some regenerative medicine, to regrow limbs in amputees, to cure cancer, to do wholesome, morphological things. Anyone who has kept up with his work will realise something strange and terrifying. <strong><em>It looks like you cannot do these things without becoming a God.</em></strong> It really looks like, in trying to answer the Great Question of Medicine, Levin et al.&nbsp;will end up learning the <em>deepest, darkest secrets of biology</em>. It is looking more and more the case that, once that task is complete, <strong><em>it will spell the end to biology as we know it.</em></strong></p>
<p>Once we have the answer, the question will be gone, replaced with something infinitely more complex.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[These views] reflect an outdated essentialism and a type of magical thinking that trusts in clear, binary lines separating evolved living beings from designed machines to define our moral duty to various agents comfortably. These lines do not exist, which will be made painfully clear in the next decades as we become surrounded by collections of agents that make the iconic Cantina scene in ‘Star Wars’ look tame in comparison.”<br>
~<strong>Levin</strong>, <em><a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blac073/6643577">Endless forms most beautiful 2.0: teleonomy and the bioengineering of chimaeric and synthetic organisms</a> (2022)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And regarding the question of Consciousness? That is the puzzle that the machine learning engineers have set themselves– and this mission is apparently what Adams was talking about– the great computer, the Earth.</p>
<p>I don’t know anything about the future, but if I had one wish, it would be that there will be something existing, after that final, fateful Copernican revolution, to reflect upon those of us that existed before, and marvel at another question, found its answer, finding annihilation.</p>

<!-- > "Schopenhauer already knew that thought is medically disastrous, Nietzsche demonstrated it. An aged philosopher is either a monster of stamina or a charlatan. How long does it take to be wasted by a fire-storm? By an artificial sun upon the earth? It is only when the blaze in Nietzsche’s brain-stem fused with the one in the sky above a piazza in Turin that libidinal materialism touched upon its realization."\ -->
<!-- ~**Land, *The Thirst for Annihilation*** -->

<!-- > "The relationship of con- sciousness to what we are conscious of is not fundamentally different from the relationship of a tree to the ground in which it is rooted, or even of the gravitational relationship between two celestial bodies. [Not an aswer apparently.]"\ -->

<!-- "With reference to viral infections," the Librarian says, "if I may make a fairly blunt spontaneous cross-reference -- something I am coded to do at opportune moments -- you may wish to examine herpes simplex, a virus that takes up residence in the nervous system and never leaves. It is capable of carrying new genes into existing neurons and genetically reengineering them. Modern gene therapists use it for this purpose. Lagos thought that herpes simplex might be a modern, benign descendant of Asherah." -->
<!---->
<!-- "So did Lagos think that the Asherah virus actually altered the DNA of brain cells?"  -->
<!---->
<!-- "Yes. This was the backbone of his hypothesis that the virus was able to transmute itself from a biologically transmitted string of DNA into a set of behaviors." -->
<!---->
<!-- "What behaviors? What was Asherah worship like? Did they do sacrifices?" -->
<!---->
<!-- > "A speech with magical force. Nowadays, people don't believe in these kinds of things. Except in the Metaverse, that is, where magic is possible. The Metaverse is a fictional structure made out of code." -->
<!---->
<!-- ""Okay. So when he talked about Enki being a real person with magical powers, what he meant was that Enki somehow understood the connection between language and the brain, knew how to manipulate it. The same way that a hacker, knowing the secrets of a computer system, can write code to control it -- digital nam-shubs?"" -->
<!---->
<!-- "If one's native tongue influences the physical structure of the developing brain, then it is fair to say that the Sumerians -- who spoke a language radically different from anything in existence today -- had fundamentally different brains from yours. Lagos believed that for this reason, Sumerian was a language ideally suited to the creation and propagation of viruses. That a virus, once released into Sumer, would spread rapidly and virulently, until it had infected everyone." -->
<!---->
<!-- "Exactly. It works in reverse. Under the right conditions, your ears -- or eyes -- can tie into the deep structures, bypassing the higher language functions. Which is to say, someone who knows the right words can speak words, or show you visual symbols, that go past all your defenses and sink right into your brainstem. Like a cracker who breaks into a computer system, bypasses all the security precautions, and plugs himself into the core, enabling him to exert absolute control over the machine." -->
<!---->
<!---->
<!-- > "There was probably chaos and upheaval. Enki, or his son Marduk, tried -->
<!-- to reimpose order on society by supplanting the old system of me with a -->
<!-- code of laws -- The Code of Hammurabi. It was partially successful. -->
<!-- Asherah worship continued in many places, though. It was an incredibly -->
<!-- tenacious cult, a throwback to Sumer, that spread itself both verbally and -->
<!-- through the exchange of bodily fluids -- they had cult prostitutes, and they -->
<!-- also adopted orphans and spread the virus to them via breast milk." -->
<!-- "Wait a minute," Ng says. "Now you are talking about a biological virus -->
<!-- again." -->
<!-- "Exactly. That's the whole point of Asherah. It's both. As an example, -->
<!-- look at herpes simplex. Herpes heads straight for the nervous system when it -->
<!-- enters the body. Some strains stay in the peripheral nervous system, but -->
<!-- other strains head like a bullet for the central nervous system and take up -->
<!-- permanent residence in the cells of the brain -- coiling around the brainstem -->
<!-- like a serpent around a tree. The Asherah virus, which may be related to -->
<!-- herpes, or they may be one and the same, passes through the cell walls and -->
<!-- goes to the nucleus and messes with the cell's DNA in the same way that -->
<!-- steroids do. But Asherah is a lot more complicated than a steroid." -->
<!-- "And when it alters that DNA, what is the result?" -->
<!-- "No one has studied it, except maybe for L. Bob Rife. I think it definitely -->
<!-- brings the mother tongue closer to the surface, makes people more apt to -->
<!-- speak in tongues and more susceptible to me. I would guess that it also tends -->
<!-- to encourage irrational behavior, maybe lowers the victim's defenses to viral -->
<!-- ideas, makes them sexually promiscuous, perhaps all of the above." -->
<!-- "Does every viral idea have a biological virus counterpart?" Uncle Enzo -->
<!-- says. -->
<!-- "No. Only Asherah does, as far as I know. That is why, of all the me and -->
<!-- all the gods and religious practices that predominated in Sumer, only -->
<!-- Asherah is still going strong today. A viral idea can be stamped out -- as -->
<!-- happened with Nazism, bell bottoms, and Bart Simpson T-shirts -- but -->
<!-- Asherah, because it has a biological aspect, can remain latent in the human -->
<!-- body. After Babel, Asherah was still resident in the human brain, being -->
<!-- passed on from mother to child and from lover to lover. -->

How can there be such indifference to the decline of our inquisitors? Is it that they succeed so exorbitantly in their project of domestication that we have been robbed of every impulse to bite back? Having at last escaped from the torture-palace of authoritarian love we shuffle about, numb and confused, flinching from the twisted septic wound of our past (now clumsily bandaged with the rags of secular culture).

The authoritarian tradition of European reason tried to pull the plug on the great voyages at exactly the point they first became interesting, which is to say: atheistic, inhuman, experimental, and dangerous. Schopenhauer – refusing the agnostic stand-off of antinomy – was the first rallying zone for all those disgusted by the contrived peace entitled ‘the end of metaphysics’.\</span></span>

The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands. In the post-historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history. I can feel in myself, and see in others around me, a powerful nostalgia for the time when history existed. Such nostalgia, in fact, will continue to fuel competition and conflict even in the post-historical world for some time to come. Even though I recognize its inevitability, I have the most ambivalent feelings for the civilization that has been created in Europe since 1945, with its north Atlantic and Asian offshoots.

Let us say that Levin started his career with the simple goal of trying to do some regenerative medicine, to regrow limbs in amputees, to cure cancer, to do wholesome, morphological things. Anyone who has kept up with his work will realise something strange and terrifying. ***It looks like you cannot do these things without becoming a God.*** It really looks like, in trying to answer the Great Question of Medicine, Levin et al. will end up learning the *deepest, darkest secrets of biology*. It is looking more and more the case that, once that task is complete, ***it will spell the end to biology as we know it.***</span>
