<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summer-school-for-access">Summer School for Access</h3>
<p><a href="../Education#The Gordon Schools Redux">Not having ‘graduated highschool’</a> (not that that means anything, as I later would argue in <a href="../Education#University of Leipzig">Leipzig</a>), I was left with limited choices for legitimizing myself in the eyes of society. This was, by this point, something I was increasingly interested in doing. Thankfully there were two universities in Scotland that had a ‘summer school for access’ programm– Aberdeen and Dundee. To Aberdeen I could commute etc., so I was packed off there.</p>
<p>The summer school was a wonderful farce, where all the oddballs of the world were sandwiched together into an improbably collective. It wasn’t just people who had left the system, like me, but also foreign students, older students, people wanting to change to radically different programms. A great collection of oddballs and we had a good time of it.</p>
</section>
<section id="maths-with-chemistry" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maths-with-chemistry">Maths with Chemistry</h3>
<p>I decided to study Maths with Chemistry, as I thought that sounded high-minded but yet practical. Unfortunately, having stopped engaging with education approximately a decade earlier, I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about in the introductory maths classes and soon dropped out. The only thing I went to in my first year was the chemistry labs, which were very fun– I had a great benchmate to crack jokes with, and would always fiddle my way through the protocol with a fair amount of flair and alacritty. I always finished an hour before everyone else, and not always because I cooked my books.</p>

<section id="neuroscience-with-psychology" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="neuroscience-with-psychology">Neuroscience with Psychology</h3>
<p>The few classes I went to in my second year (after switching majors) were dissapointing. The psychology class was just a room filled with 200 teenagers that did not give a fuck.</p>
<p>I’m hardly one to ciriticize, but at this point I had decided I needed to start shaping up, so I was dissapointed. Probably they reflected my own tardiness and incompetence in the worst possible way.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="open-university" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="open-university">Open University</h2>
<p>After two years in Aberdeen I had had enough, and had to hit the road. If I was better behaved I could of course have done erasmus, studied abroad, etc etc. But I was still a <a href="../Essays/Consciousness#Before Me">half-conscious</a> idiot and couldn’t behave. I transferred to the <a href="!W">Open University</a>, the university for wild oddballs with no money or sense. They let me skip the first year on the meager credits I scraped together from Aberdeen, and the course was only three years total. Hurrah– something I could manage.</p>
<section id="physics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="physics">Physics</h3>
<p>The course was physics. I think some part of me still saw the endeavour as something like ‘get the most prestigious degree you can with the least possible effort’, and Physics sounded suitable. I think I believed I could get through it unscathed. <a href="../Essays/Consciousness#Becoming">I was wrong</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot stress this enough: a serious study program will change you<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The final year was a <a href="../Essays/Religion">deeply religious</a> experience. I foolishly started my studies a little late– remember it was all online. So I was a few months tardy in starting the most difficult courses of my Bachelors. I started working, and I did not stop working for many months. I feel like I was almost in a blackout the entire time, I was pushing myself so hard. I had taken a <a href="???">room</a> in a squat for 80 euros a month. I had no heating or double glazing– there was ice on the inside of my windows for most of winter. I was forced into a reality that I readily accepted– like when one holds a pencil between ones teeth. It was <em>obvious</em> that I was a monk. And so I became one. I decided to do Lent in the high-romantic style borrowed from Thomas Aquinas– essentially I was vegan and could only eat when the sun was up. I would wake up every day at 6am and gorge myself on raw vegetables bought for next to nothing (or dumpster dived) from the <em>verbrauchermarkt</em>, go to the kitchen and boil a liter of water which I would add to a flask along with several spoonfulls of coffee and around 50mg of liquid amphetamines. I would then leave for the university, a long, beautiful winter walk through the parks in West Leipzig<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I would get to the university and, for the first few weeks, I would doze listlessly for several hours, my stomach groaning audibly from the effort of digesting a gross bolus of leeks or peppers or whatever bargain I was surviving off that week, drooling onto my palm or the desk. This was the punishment for my years of sleeping from 4<sup>am</sup> till noon. But it worked, and eventually my sleeping patterns came around.</p>
<p>I was studying mostly on Khan Academy. I would eventually achieve 96% percent mastery on KA<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I averaged 3 hours a day of KA for that winter (including weekends and holidays!) And the rest of the day I spent on my textbooks. I had found with the earlier years that once I read the textbooks three times I had understood them quite well. (I got over 90%<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> in my final exams for the penultimate year– I think that was a fair representation of my understanding of the course material.) However there was one module that was very calculous heavy that I never quite got to terms with completely– indeed, calculous remained a trying topic for the rest of my formal education. If I remember correctly I got something like 70% in that final exam.</p>
<p>I would work in the library until 10 or 11 pm and then make my way home to sleep. I did very little that winter– though I did meet Emma, my first longterm partner, around then, and start taking the occasional stroll with her through the Schrebergartens.</p>
<p>On Saturday I would have a ritualized <em>day of rest and relaxation</em>. This consisted of</p>
<ul>
<li>the 2 euro organ concert in the Nikolaikirch– this remains one of my most highly-rated Leipzig experiences, fantastic organist, stupendous organ, great interior– lovely church– I would without fail fall immediately into a deep and utterly peaceful slumber, my head resting against the huge columns– I used to say that that was the only place I really slept during those days– a thick dream of melody all about me–</li>
<li>I would then go to TEDi (a 1-euro shop) and buy a packet of peanut flips for a euro, and eat it as I walked</li>
<li>and I would finish up at the absinth bar, which was a strange and utterly-not-rateable (that is, <em>too poor to rate</em>) sort of haloween or goth-themed absinth bar which neverthless had an impressive selection, where I would get the house absinth on the rocks for 2 euros 40 cents</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was that. The only other thing to report from this time was the stress-induced fantasies of bodily mutilation that would plague me in the library, so much so that I started keeping a diary in which I reported them in graphic detail in order to exorcise them, with mixed success. May the Gods forget that unholy book.</p>

<p>I went to speak to the head of studies at the Chemistry department to ask if I could do a Masters in Chemistry with them. He found this absurd and hilarious. Germans don’t think highly of us Brits and our felixibilty of mind it seems. <em>Augen zu und durch</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="physics-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="physics-1">Physics</h3>
<p>I studied Physics in <a href="../Reviews/Spaces/Urban/Cities#Leipzig">Leipzig</a> for two years. It was, in many important ways, the most fullfilling time of my life. However, it was also incredibly draining– remember, I was competing with people who had come there directly from a decade of continuous mathematics education, in German universities. I was a degenerate wanderer who was kicked out of school at the age of 15. I had to push myself further than I ever imagined I would. I learned a great deal, about my limits and my capacities, and about physics.</p>
<p>I focussed almost entirely on bio-related topics. Before the course began I investigated various departments, until I found one that had the dearly-sought line– <em>we have student jobs available</em>. I needed work desperately. I signed up for that class and a few others, and determined to woo the professor in short order.</p>
<p>When my course started I was camping in an abandoned factory with an artist friend of mine. Every morning I would wake up, get dressed in a suit, hide my sleeping back in the floorboards of our building and walk to university. I had heard about LaTeX from somewhere, and figured it would work as a way of impressing my professor. The first homeworks were given out at the end of week two. That weekend I would spend one of only a few weekends I spent in the 24-hour library in the center– sweet charity for the dark Gods of academic intellect– so few because I was soon to have my own place of study. I did the homework, taught myself LaTex, and presented it beautifully over the course of 40-some hours. I handed it in on Monday, ink crisp. A few days later I recieved the praise I was waiting for– bide your time! Another homework at the end of that week, another beautiful LaTex document, and this time after it was marked and the compliments paid I asked the professor about the student jobs.</p>
<p>I worked for him for two years. All the things I should say I will say– I learned so much more, not only contextualizing the classwork, but I was doing real research, they taught me how to code, I earned their trust, they gave me a great project. I was treated like a PhD student essentially. Much could be said about that job, only good things. Poverty was my fairy godmother. The Irish bar that turned me down after three (unpaid!) trial shifts only a few weeks before– they knew I was destined for greater things, they meant it charitably of course. No longer for that world was I! Now I think about it I might, now, in recent years, finally have spent more time behind the keyboard than the bar<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the studies– I had wanted to move back towards biochemistry for some time anyway, and I found biophysics suited me quite fine. I found (surprising no-one perhaps?) that I had a flair for public speaking<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and did my very best at the seminar classes. Two of the talks I gave for the Understanding Entropy seminar remain among my very proudest work. I intend to copy them on here sometime.</p>
<p>The research I was doing in my student job morphed into my masters thesis– I designed and built a custom microscope for molecular force spectroscopy, I had a budget of 40 thousand euros and very little oversight, it was heaven. I just played with lasers, listened to New Yorker literature podcasts and wrote software for 9 months in my own lab/office.</p>
<p>Two professors offered me PhD positions. I turned them down, and fled, ashamed, to the road. 5 days after my final defence I was in India.</p>

<section id="boot-camp-in-india" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boot-camp-in-india">‘Boot Camp’ in India</h3>
<p>I fled partly because I had terrible imposter syndrome and partly because I had run my brain ragged teaching it all of maths and physics in four years from a sitting, stoned, start. I was utterly terrified of the Thoeretical Physics professor who wanted to take me on, because I loved him, and I worried I would die trying to impress him. Also, more charitably to myself perhaps, I knew that I needed to learn to code, this much had become crystal clear from the research group I worked in, where the ratio of programming expertise to programming dependency left an enormous gaping hole that a scrupulous individual could cut an effective swathe through. And I had an enormous pile of research papers and books that had been piling up as I had run out of time to read.</p>
<p>I stuffed a small backpack with pulped, pressed, printed wooden matter, one pair of socks, one item of underwear, a spare shirt, and set off.</p>
<p>I will <a href="../Travel/Journeys#winter-2017-2018">skip the travelogue</a> and go straight to the study– aside from the many fasinating research papers that I read at the time, my main educational mission was to learn python. I bought a ticket out of Mumbai in short order to a city I had found on a list of cities sorted by cost of living (cheapest first) which noone had ever heard of, obviating the need for any will power to keep me out of the way of distraction. Mangalore<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> it was called. I rented a room on the beach and started studying. My plan was to play with cellular automata. It was a great deal of fun, and served as a good enough fundament for my first applications.</p>

<section id="startup-life" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="startup-life">Startup Life</h3>
<p>The great benefit of working at startups is, you are expected to learn on the job, and they pay you little enough to encourage it. I learned a great deal of <em>craft</em> in startups. It is not the grand, mind-expanding knowledge of Physics, but it is valuable–nay, essential. I am, by now, a competent craftsman with code, with Linux, with Cloud Computing, with Databases, with system design etc etc. It has also changed me. And it has only been three years, shorter than a typical degree, and I had much more time for pleasure and travel in these years. And they do pay you! I find startup life quite fine, quite fine indeed.</p>
<p>The startup years are covered in the essay on <a href="../Essays/Work.html">work</a>. So for now I will leave you here.</p>

<section id="conclusions" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>This is a living document. I will of course expand the sections, but will I add more sections? Will I ever do a PhD?</p>
<p>I don’t have to. I would like to. I don’t feel like it is strictly necessary. Lets see. It is still open. I doubt I would have the capacity for a PhD in Physics at this point, but I think I could manage some biophysics or genetics, and I did learn to code for a reason. I have a reading list and a plan, in case I ever see the need.</p>
<p>Naturally, starting this blog is an important part of my decision process. Maybe I pick up and put down a few fresh skills here, to round off my portfolio. Or maybe I learn that you don’t have to be a Doctor to make a Difference. Lets see! Welcome to my decision process, I hope you have a pleasant stay.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The effect is of course magnified by the fact that you understake your studies at a particularly dramatic point in your development– though personally speaking, I was 25 at this point, so would have been over the development hump.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>One of the colder winters, after I had a student job and some more security, walking back along that same path after some weeks of freezing fog had been rolling slowly through the woods, there was a rich dust of <em>purple ice</em> on the trees. This was the same and only winter that I walked on the rivers and canals of Leipzig, a wonderful experience, a wonderful warm winter now I had graduated to middle-class civilzation– central heating! Double glazing!<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>I am still a believer in online learning, and look forward to seeing what generations to come– or rather, already alive! Make of it.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Of course this is meaningless without context. OU courses typically expect quite a high degree of mastery of the material.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn6"><p>And people wonder why I don’t complain about working long hours for less than minimum wage that is the fare of the researcher. I don’t get callouses anymore. Much as I enjoyed my many working-class coworkers, and much as the priviledged elite ones that I work with more and more annoy me with their sometime pettiness and complaints, I wouldn’t go back.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>I may be tall and native-english speaking and various other things, but I can’t help but suspect that the many rehearsals and run-throughs I did, and the meticulous slides I made must have contributed a little to my success.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
