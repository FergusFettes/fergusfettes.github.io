<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summer-school-for-access">Summer School for Access</h3>
<p><a href="../Education#The Gordon Schools Redux">Not having ‘graduated highschool’</a> (not that that means anything, as I later would argue in <a href="../Education#University of Leipzig">Leipzig</a>), I was left with limited choices for legitimizing myself in the eyes of society. This was, by this point, something I was increasingly interested in doing. Thankfully there were two universities in Scotland that had a ‘summer school for access’ programm– Aberdeen and Dundee. To Aberdeen I could commute etc., so I was packed off there.</p>
<p>The summer school was a wonderful farce, where all the oddballs of the world were sandwiched together into an improbably collective. It wasn’t just people who had left the system, like me, but also foreign students, older students, people wanting to change to radically different programms. A great collection of oddballs and we had a good time of it.</p>
</section>
<section id="maths-with-chemistry" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maths-with-chemistry">Maths with Chemistry</h3>
<p>I decided to study Maths with Chemistry, as I thought that sounded high-minded but yet practical. Unfortunately, having stopped engaging with education approximately a decade earlier, I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about in the introductory maths classes and soon dropped out. The only thing I went to in my first year was the chemistry labs, which were very fun– I had a great benchmate to crack jokes with, and would always fiddle my way through the protocol with a fair amount of flair and alacritty. I always finished an hour before everyone else, and not always because I cooked my books.</p>
</section>
<section id="neuroscience-with-psychology" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="neuroscience-with-psychology">Neuroscience with Psychology</h3>
<p>The few classes I went to in my seconds year (after switching majors) were dissapointing. The psychology class was just a room filled with 200 teenagers that did not give a fuck.</p>
<p>I’m hardly one to ciriticize, but at this point I had decided I needed to start shaping up, so I was dissapointed. Probably they reflected my own tardiness and incompetence in the worst possible way.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="open-university" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="open-university">Open University</h2>
<p>After two years in Aberdeen I had had enough, and had to hit the road. If I was better behaved I could of course have done erasmus, studied abroad, etc etc. But I was still a <a href="../Essays/Consciousness#Before Me">half-conscious</a> idiot and couldn’t behave. I transferred to the <a href="!W">Open University</a>, the university for wild oddballs with no money or sense. They let me skip the first year on the meager credits I scraped together from Aberdeen, and the course was only three years total. Hurrah– something I could manage.</p>
<section id="physics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="physics">Physics</h3>
<p>The course was physics. I think some part of me still saw the endeavour as something like ‘get the most prestigious degree you can with the least possible effort’, and Physics sounded suitable. I think I believed I could get through it unscathed. <a href="../Essays/Consciousness#Becoming">I was wrong</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot stress this enough: a serious study program will change you[^magnified].</p>
<p>[^magnified] The effect is of course magnified by the fact that you understake your studies at a particularly dramatic point in your development– though personally speaking, I was 25 at this point, so would have been over the development hump.</p>
<p>The second year was a <a href="../Essays/Religion">deeply religious</a> experience. I will write about it im more length at some point.</p>

<section id="chemistry" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chemistry">Chemistry</h3>
<p>I went to speak to the head of studies at the Chemistry department to ask if I could do a Masters in Chemistry with them. He said found this absurd and hilarious.</p>
</section>
<section id="physics-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="physics-1">Physics</h3>
<p>I studied Physics in <a href="../Reviews/Spaces/Urban/Cities#Leipzig">Leipzig</a> for two years. It was, in many important ways, the most fullfilling time of my life. However, it was also incredibly draining– remember, I was competing with people who had come there directly from a decade of continuous mathematics education, in German universities. I was a degenerate wanderer who was kicked out of school at the age of 15. I had to push myself further than I ever imagined I would. I learned a great deal, about my limits and my capacities, and about physics.</p>
<p>Two professors offered me PhD positions. I turned them down, and fled, ashamed, to the road. 5 days after my final defence I was in India.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>This is a living document. I will of course expand the sections, but will I add more sections? Will I ever do a PhD?</p>
<p>I don’t have to. I would like to. I don’t feel like it is strictly necessary. Lets see. It is still open. I doubt I would have the capacity for a PhD in Physics at this point, but I think I could manage some biophysics or genetics, and I did learn to code for a reason. I have a reading list and a plan, in case I ever see the need.</p>
<p>Naturally, starting this blog is an important part of my decision process. Maybe I pick up and put down a few fresh skills here, to round off my portfolio. Or maybe I learn at you don’t have to be a Doctor to make a Difference. Lets see! Welcome to my decision process, I hope you have a pleasant stay.</p>
