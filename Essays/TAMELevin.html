<h1>Quotes</h1>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic biology and bioengineering provide the opportunity to create novel embodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of chimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software. These advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences, whose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model species. In this Perspective, I introduce TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a nonbinary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. TAME provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates. When applied to regenerating/developmental systems, TAME suggests a perspective on morphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep symmetry between problem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D (traditional behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive capacities can increase during evolution. An important medium exploited by evolution for joining active subunits into greater agents is developmental bioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap junctions to scale up cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This architecture of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important implications for plasticity of bodies and minds, greatly potentiating evolvability. Considering classical and recent data from the perspectives of computational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals a rich research program with many implications for cognitive science, evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>“In this Perspective, I introduce TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a nonbinary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. TAME provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“All known cognitive agents are collective intelligences, because we are all made of parts; biological agents in particular are not just structurally modular, but made of parts that are themselves agents in important ways. There is no truly monadic, indivisible yet cognitive being: all known minds reside in physical systems composed of components of various complexity and active behavior.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The framework, TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—adopts a practical, constructive engineering perspective on the optimal place for a given system on the continuum of cognitive sophistication. This gives rise to an axis of persuadability (Figure 2), which is closely related to the Intentional Stance (Dennett, 1987) but made more explicit in terms of functional engineering approaches needed to implement prediction and control in practice. Persuadability refers to the type of conceptual and practical tools that are optimal to rationally modify a given system’s behavior. The origin story (designed vs.&nbsp;evolved), composition, and other aspects are not definitive guides to the correct level of agency for a living or non-living system. Instead, one must perform experiments to see which kind of intervention strategy provides the most efficient prediction and control (thus, one aim should be generalizing the human-focused Turing Test and other IQ metrics into a broader agency detection toolkit, which perhaps could itself be implemented by a useful algorithm).”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“These hypotheses suggest a specific way to understand the scaling of cognitive capacity through evolution, make interesting predictions, and suggest novel experimental work. They also provide ways to think about the impending expansion of the “space of possible bodies and minds” via the efforts of bioengineers, which is sure to disrupt categories and conclusions that have been formed in the context of today’s natural biosphere.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Selves exist across a continuum of persuadability, and it is an empirical question as to where on this axis any given system lies (revealed by the ratio of prediction and control vs.&nbsp;effort and knowledge that needs to be input, for any given way of relating to that system).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selves are not fixed, permanent agents—their substrate can remodel radically during their lifetime; the owner of memories and preferences, and the subject that interprets rewards and punishments, is malleable and plastic.</p>
<p>The core of being a Self is the ability to pursue goals. Selves can be nested and overlapping, cooperating and competing both laterally and across levels. Each higher-level self deforms the option space for the lower level Selves, enabling them to follow energy minimization to achieve outcomes that look inevitable and simple at one scale, while serving intelligent goals at a higher scale.”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A proposed way to visualize <em>a continuum of agency</em>, which frames the problem in a way that is testable and drives empirical progress, is <em>via an “axis of persuadability”: to what level of control</em> (ranging from brute force micromanagement to persuasion by rational argument) <em>is any given system amenable</em>, given the sophistication of its cognitive apparatus?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The main goal is to help advance and delineate an exciting emerging field at the intersection of biology, philosophy, and the information sciences. <em>By proposing a new framework and examining it in a broad context of now physically realizable (not merely logically possible) living structures, it may be possible to bring conceptual, philosophical thought up to date with recent advances in science and technology.</em> At stake are current knowledge gaps in evolutionary, developmental, and cell biology, a new roadmap for regenerative medicine, lessons that could be ported to artificial intelligence and robotics, and broader implications for ethics.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This is crucial to understanding agency and intelligence at multiple scales and in unfamiliar embodiments because observations like this begin to break down the notion of Selves as monadic, immutable objects with a privileged scale. Becoming comfortable with biological cognitive agents that are malleable in terms of form and function (change radically during the lifetime of an individual) makes it easier to understand the origins and changes of cognition during evolution or as the result of bioengineering effort.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Even when housed in the same “body,” memories must move between tissues—for example, in a trained planarian’s tail fragment re-imprinting its learned information onto the newly regenerated brain, or the movement of memories onto new brain tissue during metamorphosis. In addition to the spatial movement and re-mapping of memories onto new substrates, there is also a temporal component, as each memory is really an instance of communication between past and future Selves. <em>The plasticity of biological bodies, made of cells that die, are born, and significantly rearrange their tissue architecture, suggests that the understanding of cognition is fundamentally a problem of collective intelligence: to understand how stable cognitive structures can persist and map onto swarm dynamics</em>, with preferences and stressors that scale from those of their components.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“First, the gulf between planarian regeneration/insect metamorphosis and human brains is going to be bridged by emerging therapeutics. <em>It is inevitable that stem cell therapies for degenerative brain diseases (Forraz et al., 2013; Rosser and Svendsen, 2014; Tanna and Sachan, 2014) will confront us with humans whose brains are partially replaced by the naïve progeny of cells that were not present during the formation of memories and personality traits in the patient.</em> Even prior to these advances, it was clear that phenomena such as dissociative identity disorder (Miller and Triggiano, 1992), communication with non-verbal brain hemispheres in commissurotomy patients (Nagel, 1971; Montgomery, 2003), conjoined twins with fused brains (Gazzaniga, 1970; Barilan, 2003), etc., place human cognition onto a continuous spectrum with respect to the plasticity of integrated Selves that reside within a particular biological tissue implementation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“For example, it is now easy to radically modify bodies in a time-scale that is much faster than evolutionary change, to study the inherent plasticity of minds without eons of selection to shape them to fit specific body architectures. When tadpoles are created to have eyes on their tails, instead of their heads, they are still readily able to perform visual learning tasks. Planaria can readily be made with two (or more) brains in the same body, and human patients are now routinely augmented with novel inputs such as sensory substitution or novel effectors, such as instrumentized interfaces allowing thought to control engineered devices such as wheelchairs in addition to the default muscle-driven peripherals of their own bodies. The central phenomenon here is plasticity: minds are not tightly bound to one specific underlying architecture (as most of our software is today), but readily mold to changes of genomic defaults. The logical extension of this progress is a focus on self-modifying living beings and the creation of new agents in which the mind:body system is simplified by entirely replacing one side of the equation with an engineered construct. The benefit would be that at least one half of the system is now well-understood.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Biobots, hybrots, cyborgs, synthetic and chimeric animals, genetically and cellularly bioengineered living forms, humans instrumentized to knowledge platforms, devices, and each other—these technologies are going to generate beings whose body architectures are nothing like our familiar phylogeny. They will be a functional mix of evolved and designed components; at all levels, smart materials, software-level systems, and living tissue will be integrated into novel beings which function in their own exotic Umwelt.”</p>

<span id="cb1-25"><a href="#cb1-25" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Abstract: Synthetic biology and bioengineering provide the opportunity to create novel embodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of chimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software. These advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences, whose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model species. In this Perspective, I introduce TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a nonbinary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. TAME provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates. When applied to regenerating/developmental systems, TAME suggests a perspective on morphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep symmetry between problem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D (traditional behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive capacities can increase during evolution. An important medium exploited by evolution for joining active subunits into greater agents is developmental bioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap junctions to scale up cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This architecture of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important implications for plasticity of bodies and minds, greatly potentiating evolvability. Considering classical and recent data from the perspectives of computational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals a rich research program with many implications for cognitive science, evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence.</span>

This gives rise to an axis of persuadability (Figure 2), which is closely related to the Intentional Stance (Dennett, 1987) but made more explicit in terms of functional engineering approaches needed to implement prediction and control in practice. Persuadability refers to the type of conceptual and practical tools that are optimal to rationally modify a given system’s behavior. The origin story (designed vs. evolved), composition, and other aspects are not definitive guides to the correct level of agency for a living or non-living system. Instead, one must perform experiments to see which kind of intervention strategy provides the most efficient prediction and control (thus, one aim should be generalizing the human-focused Turing Test and other IQ metrics into a broader agency detection toolkit, which perhaps could itself be implemented by a useful algorithm)."</span></span>

In addition to the spatial movement and re-mapping of memories onto new substrates, there is also a temporal component, as each memory is really an instance of communication between past and future Selves. *The plasticity of biological bodies, made of cells that die, are born, and significantly rearrange their tissue architecture, suggests that the understanding of cognition is fundamentally a problem of collective intelligence: to understand how stable cognitive structures can persist and map onto swarm dynamics*, with preferences and stressors that scale from those of their components."</span></span>

When tadpoles are created to have eyes on their tails, instead of their heads, they are still readily able to perform visual learning tasks. Planaria can readily be made with two (or more) brains in the same body, and human patients are now routinely augmented with novel inputs such as sensory substitution or novel effectors, such as instrumentized interfaces allowing thought to control engineered devices such as wheelchairs in addition to the default muscle-driven peripherals of their own bodies. The central phenomenon here is plasticity: minds are not tightly bound to one specific underlying architecture (as most of our software is today), but readily mold to changes of genomic defaults. The logical extension of this progress is a focus on self-modifying living beings and the creation of new agents in which the mind:body system is simplified by entirely replacing one side of the equation with an engineered construct. The benefit would be that at least one half of the system is now well-understood."</span></span>
