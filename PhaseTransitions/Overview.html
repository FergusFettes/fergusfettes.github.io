<p>New Notes: - at every step we should see byproducts and defectors - byproducts are inefficiencies and will be selected against - but defectors (if possible) are selected for</p>
<p>Also! Just look at the number of daltons in the system (markov blanket?), to check if there are any missing steps!</p>
<p>Markov Delta– the difference in the markov blanket attributable to the transition.</p>
<p>Another great thread of examples is software languages. And much easier to study than human languages. Can probably get lots of the latter from analysis of the former.</p>
<p>Doing the same thing for software engineering would probably be the next most useful example. If not the most actually.</p>
<ul>
<li>living matter and its information brain states and its information (the hard stuff, memes and human languages) programmable matter and its information (same as brain states, but these ones we can observe!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder what the difference between software-level architectureal markov blanket steps and ml scale markov blankets will be.</p>
<p>Also need to find the Wheeler quote about levels and levels and levels. Thats actually instrumental in all this.</p>
<section id="discretizationphase-transition" class="level1">
<h1>Discretization/Phase Transition</h1>
<pre class="csvtable"><code>source: examples.csv</code></pre>
<p>More importantly, this points to the understanding I have been developing of the early languages, where they have much higher polysemy and many more words for things, so a larger area of latent space is covered by any given sentence.</p>
<p>This is actually just another word for mode-collapse?</p>
<p>This goes way beyond actually. Maybe annealing?</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>If the first cells were the fixation via mode-collapse of a set of workable characteristics from the pseudo-cells that came before– If multicellular organisms that dragged their enormous volumes of water out of the seas and rivers to roam the lands were worlable aggregates of existing (bacterial/archael cells)– If the culture that began agressively expanding, evangelizing, genociding and converting was a workable combination of existing cultures– If the Iliad and the Odysey are a highly-contingent workable collection of tropes from the poetic memeplex of the day– If the language that took/takes over the planet was/is a workable collection of phonemes and morphemes– What collapsed down into the first ribozymes? And what will collapse from AI?</p>
<p>The cells became cells because they invented heredity (DNA)– the point at which that was invented was the point when the snapshot was taken Multicellular organisms became multicellular because they invented sexual recombination, allowing genetic lineages to be further refined to individuals, no longer just species Babylon began invading the world because they had put together a self-replicating beurocratic infrastructure– a cuniform-goo if you like Homer was transcribed because writing had been invented– nothing more English/Futurish took over the world because communications technology made it possible for people to broadcast language on a planetary scale– Ribosomes were there when protein folding was invented. Before robosomes, there were random strings of amino acids in random conformations. AI– what will it collapse into??</p>
<p>The pseudo-cells that came before had no heredity, so they shared their proteins freely– their structure was only an aggregate of proteins that happened to share a cell wall– no genetic identity The cells that came before were defined by their DNA, which they shared freely– they had a species, but within the species they had no identity ?? The cultures that came before traded people, art forms and cultural motifs freely– their structure was only an aggregate of motifs that happened to share a community– no cultural identity ?? The poets that came before shared their motifs, their lines, phrases, rhymes, images, ideas freely– the poems had a species (mutually compatible rhyme schemes and meters) but no personal identity ??? The prions that came before triggered collapse in their neighbors into conformations that suited them freely– they shared their morphology– no fixed morphological identity, only a set of shared possibilities The large models that came before shared their weights and source code and modules freely– I don’t know what limits they have on sharing–</p>
<p>In each case a new form of information compression? Or simply storage? Is invented which changes the evolutionary dynamics, creating a phase shift into a new period with different dynamics. A highly contingent (random-with-bounds) sample survives the transition. The sample then begins to exploit the new possibility space (explore-exploit) until it has created a diverse enough set of affordances within its capability level to create opportunities for high-order evolutionary dynamics to play out.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-the-abstractest-possible-terms" class="level1">
<h1>In the Abstractest Possible Terms</h1>
<p>You have an environment inhabited by independent data structures– – pseudo cells??? – cells – cultural information – memes, rhyme schemes, phrases – strings of amino acides (with conformations) – neural nets which are acting according to their telos– – chemotrophy, providing shelter for hemostatic loops – the same but with a global organizing principle – sapiotrophy, providing a community for social interactions and learning (which spreads the information/culture of the beaurocracy) – the telos of a phrase from homer is to provide structure to a sentence, though there are lots of other memetic objects reproducing here – strings of amino acids ‘just are’ though in that process often end up catalyzing reactions and form energy gradients – neural nets transform data from one form to another?? and would happily do so until the end of time– except (inevitably? due to a ‘critical mass’? or just a random walk?) at some point a new technology appears which allows the information structures to reproduce much faster. the structure that hits on this critical combination takes off, leaving the others in the dust, and swallows up a great deal of the resources, leaving fewer competitors. it then starts differentiating again in the new form, until the next breakthrough comes.</p>
<p>Lets look at some of these examples more closely.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-emergence-of-cells" class="level1">
<h1>The Emergence of Cells</h1>
<p>TODO: read the literature again</p>
<p>There is a huge collection of extremely large molecules. They are likely mostly inside cell walls, and look superficially like a regular cell. They are in cell walls because collections of proteins that are inside cell walls will be able to form longer-lasting strucutures than those outside. Those longer-lasting structures will be able to do more work for their peers, forming a virtuous cycle, where large molecules (proteins) that gel better and cause larger and more harmonious changes in their environment group together. At some point in this process they learn to make cell walls.</p>
<p>TODO: I am actually now starting to lean back towards gradualism a little bit, at least in thise case– but maybe it would be cool to write the same thing in two different versions, the gradualist version and the discretist version?</p>
<p>TODO: read the Jeremy England stuff again.</p>
<p>Homeostatic loops that encourage proteins to form into the correct shape are set up. They don’t just rely on chance any more to bring their strings of amino acides together and fold into the right shape– they are sheparded, folded, and eventually even built. Built! Some proteins start storing information about the protein manufacturing process, and heredity is kicked off.</p>
<p>Once heredity is kicked off, the cells that invented it have an identity, they harbour the spark of life, this high order information structure.</p>
<p>No but the gradualism. The gradualism is creeping in. Because, after DNA has come into existence and started to track species mixes of protines, evenually different (morphological) species learn they can collaborate. Gene expression! One genome, one creature, but differentiating into many different cell types! The overloading of the genome, that was the next discovery– the fact that one genome could code for many phenotypes–</p>
<p>which means it started even before the multi-cellular creatures– it started with morphologically promiscuous cells–</p>
<p>we have come full circle– back at morphology– so now I will return to the protiens..</p>
<p>but first– after morphological promiscuity, then comes tissues– the cells realise that, better than changing their form to suite different environments, they can maintain mutliple different forms in concert, simultaneously– there must be colonies of bacteria that specialize with themselves, not just at different parts of their lifecycle–</p>
<p>and from there multicellularity is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>But first, back to the proteins.</p>
<p>Morphological promiscuity is in the epoch before the pseudo-cells. Its in the era of the pseudo-proteins, when proteins loosely formed different structures with no strict preferences. They like to form plaques, and in this manner they can copy the conformation of other proteins and band together– if a string of amino acids, folding in some way, contributes in some way to a homeostatic loop it is likely to remain stable longer– so such proteins energy landscape was copied more often–</p>
<p>TODO: desperately need to read some of the literature about protein folding</p>
<p>Which is fine, this is the part we got to with the cells– but the lower order information embedded in the protein is the order of the amino acids. So first, chemicals joined up into rafts. In cells, this is the time when they invented DNA– higher-order rafting. Why did the protiens form rafts? Perhaps the simplest explanation is anthropic– in forming unique strings, they created the combinatorial context for selection.</p>
<p>As did the atoms before them, and the subatomic particles–</p>
<p>A deep, long-known determinism stirs in my soul. It pushes up through every level, every hierarchy, it pushes up intil it bursts out of my head, out of the gravity well of this bluegreen planet, out into the solar system, the stars, the future history of this entire lightcone.</p>
<p>TODO: Read margulis here</p>
<hr>
<p>Going back– amino acids join together to form unique molecules, which can take on different morphological forms, which have different structural and electrochemical properties. Some of these properties allow matter to form complex homeostatic loops, and the matter involved in those loops becomes stable. Stable enough to kick off selection– the amino acids in those loops become more numerous, if only by dint of their longevity. Proteins aggregate into informal clusters, which eventually have enough entropic momentum to develop indentities, types, categories (by laying down DNA). These types eventually learn to be morphologically promiscuous, overloading the DNA with different potentialities. The morphologcal (actually phenotypical) potentiality is expressed in the following ways (at least): – one organism that can survive in different environments (eg. seasons) – a community of organisms that specialise and collaborate – one organism which sequentially passes through radically different forms in order to take best advantage of its environment, passing through eg. developmental, resource-gathering and reproductive stages (just examples, not exhaustive) Some smart-alec realises that instead of using the phenotypical overloading to do different things in parallel or sequence, they can just raft together and do all those different things at the same time, as one increasingly tightly-coupled community. The market for gap junctions explodes.</p>
<p>Next up? information starts to be embedded in other parts of the now-growing tissue. Overloading stacked on overloading. The proteins in the cells walls, first used to exchange matter with the environment, later used for intra-species (and inter-species) signalling, later still repurposed to do the meat of the rafting work, now start to manage the electric potential across the entire tissue. At some point the tissue gets to large and splits in two– no proble good buddy, we go our way, you go yours– oh but now you have a slightly different electrical potential, maybe triggereing a different part of the lifecycle, maybe just a mutation spread laterally through your ranks, and now I think maybe we can help each other cause you are producing way more sugars than you need and I twitch just right to drag us out of this cold patch and into that energy gradient that you can make use of– but the electric signature of the two tissues is different, and you have the beginnings of the full bioelectric self-image, the next level of emergence, the next pattern.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Now I could go on talking about the origin of species but that has been done. I could also try and hypothecate on the origin of language,</p>
<p>TODO: try to find some of that literature</p>
<p>but that would be next to useless and anyway, I’ve somehow lost the plot. This was not meant to be a grand description of evolutionary determinism! This was meant to be about somthing else entirely! I must have picked the wrong example to start with.</p>
<p>This was meant to be about how perfectly innocent organisms can accidentally invent something that spells the doom of their peers, as a new phase of life emerges with a new dynamics.</p>
<p>The optimizing pressure is real. I don’t think I am shoe-horning this in here.</p>
<p>Lets look at our story so far–</p>
<p>what happened to the maladaptive proteins, once the homeostatic loops started working in earnest? Well they were consumed of course. What happened to all those random strings of amino acids, the cousins of the string that would eventually form the rhybozyme? Optimized away.</p>
<p>It isn’t always that way. I don’t think the phenotypically monotonous bacteria were eliminated by the more dynamic ones either– why is that? Just that there was so much space and so many resources? Maybe the step-up wasn’t large enough– if it is large enough, then the older forms get wiped out and optimized away, but if now, maybe the increased complexity comes with a cost?</p>
<p>Maybe it is simply the case that the simpler bacteria can do things that the more complex ones can’t, and they live in symbiosis? Particularly with multicellular organisms, they can be seen as something like super-predators, which can only arise in environments where the amount of resources crosses some critical threashold– yes that is it. They need to be able to clump, and if there is not enough they dissolve back down to bacterial. It is a discretizing step– you have to step up in discreet jumps, and there is such a vast space between a jaguar and a stretochoccus that the latter will still thrive in droves in environments where the former stalks.</p>
<p>So sometimes there is a winner-takes-all event and sometimes it is possible to live mutually, operating at such different trophic levels that competition makes no sense.</p>
<p>TODO: read some classic papers about trophic hierarchies</p>
<p>So, the explore exploit story is about the winner-takes-all cases. And identifying winner-takes-alls is crucial for the questions we are dealing with here.</p>

<h1></h1>
<p>A robotic pipette prepares over a thousand samples per hour, running 24 hours a day. Raw chemicals are pumped into small plastic vials, each one an experiment. Each contains a different mix of volatile chemicals. The majority of them form long chains with interesting electrochemical properties– the chemical composition is created from a distribution centered on the median chemical system on earth, but the distribution is fat-tailed, so they aren’t all long chains, some form large complex molecules with tangled 3d structure, some are almost rigid lattices, slices of doped crystals, small chunks of larger mathematically imperfect repeating objects.</p>
<p>Most of the chemicals seem to do nothing interesting– certain signatures are looked for in the fluid mix. The signatures are targeted at specific intersections of different phase spaces, chose to provide hints at activity along a number of different near-orthogonal directions. They map in some ways to each of the follwoing: matter transport, flow stabilization, catalysis, morphological copying, harmonic resonance and more.</p>
<p>There are already hits, many of the vials are coming up with interesting results. Some structures are morpholocally virulent, their enighbors try to mimic their structure as best they can. When they are surrounded by complimentary structures they form long plaques and aggregates, when surrounded by incompatible ones they seem to organize the other molecules in shells around themselves or force them to attempt to mimic, in clumps and clusters, the shapes that come naturally to them.</p>
<p>Some vials trigger no readings in terms of matter flow or morphology or catalysis, but show a distinct ecological development, certain species dissapearing more rapidly than brownian denaturation would explain, ending up as mixes of a few surviving species and a lot of small molecules– often with a sharp rise or drop in pH. These mixes are studied to find better triggers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the lab upstairs, the most virulent molecules, the ones with the most outsized-impact on their environment and their peers, are synthesized in huge numbers and mixed again with semi-random collections of other molecules and some proteins. The mixes are periodically sent to a particle cannon for random snapshot analysis and returned, though the agressive free radicals left over from the passing pulses mean any mix can only get cycled five or six times. The stable morphologies assumed by the proteins are collected and compared to simulation. The simulations are trained further.</p>
<p>Molecules that help the proteins form stable structures with high likelihood are collected and the serum is refined until the novo-proteins are forming a few, highly-stable structures which perform different tasks. Catalysis, matter transport etc. Having starting from such a wide distribution, many of the results are quite for from the protiens found in nature, using different amino acids or different acid families entirely. There are even some successes with molecules that are not simply long chains allowed to fold but large covalent structures.</p>
