1,Biomolecular Basis of Cellular Consciousness via Subcellular Nanobrains,Economic Basis of Socioconsciousness via Autopoietic Social Structures
2,"Abstract: Cells emerged at the very beginning of life on Earth and, in fact, are coterminous with life. They are enclosed within an excitable plasma membrane, which defines the outside and inside domains via their specific biophysical properties. Unicellular organisms, such as diverse protists and algae, still live a cellular life. However, fungi, plants, and animals evolved a multicellular existence. Recently, we have developed the cellular basis of consciousness (CBC) model, which proposes that all biological awareness, sentience and consciousness are grounded in general cell biology. Here we discuss the biomolecular structures and processes that allow for and maintain this cellular consciousness from an evolutionary perspective."," Abstract: Societies emerged at the very beginning of human civilization and, in fact, are coterminous with civilization. They are enclosed within a shared cultural framework, which defines the inside and outside domains via their specific historical, economic, and political properties. Tribal societies, such as diverse indigenous cultures, still live a communal life. However, complex societies evolved a multicultural existence. Recently, we have developed the socioconsciousness model, which proposes that all societal awareness, group sentience and collective consciousness are grounded in general social structures and interactions. Here we discuss the economic structures and processes that allow for and maintain this socioconsciousness from an evolutionary perspective."
3,"1. Cellular Nature of Life Nobel Prize winner Sir Paul Nurse in his latest book, What is Life? laments that we are underestimating cells [1]. He notes that every cell is a living entity endowed with all the properties that characterize living organisms. Unfortunately, the original form of Cell Theory, as postulated more than a hundred years ago, is plagued with several conceptual problems [2– 5]. It is often ignored or forgotten that eukaryotic cells can, in fact, be viewed as multicellular ecosystems, in effect “cells within cells” [6,7 ]. Their organelles, such as mitochondria and plastids, are semi-autonomous endosymbiotic cells [ 8–13 ]. The symbiotic origin of the nucleus is emerging as a highly plausible scenario [ 9,14 –17 ]. Cell theory has been an important concept unifying the whole of biology and has played a central role in our understanding of life [ 1,18 –20 ]. However, several aspects of the theory require attention and amendment. A model based on biomolecular mechanisms of cellular consciousness [14,21,22] is a prime candidate in this respect, as it holds the key to a better understanding of life [22,23].","1. Societal Nature of Civilization Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen in his latest book, What is Civilization? laments that we are underestimating societies [1]. He notes that every society is a living entity endowed with all the properties that characterize civilizations. Unfortunately, the original form of Sociology, as postulated more than a hundred years ago, is plagued with several conceptual problems [2– 5]. It is often ignored or forgotten that complex societies can, in fact, be viewed as multicultural ecosystems, in effect “socieities within societies” [6,7 ]. Their subcultures, such as interest groups and political movements, are semi-autonomous endosymbiotic societies [ 8–13 ]. The symbiotic origin of the state is emerging as a highly plausible scenario [ 9,14 –17 ]. Sociology has been an important concept unifying the whole of social sciences and has played a central role in our understanding of civilization [ 1,18 –20 ]. However, several aspects of the theory require attention and amendment. A model based on economic mechanisms of socioconsciousness [14,21, 22] is a prime candidate in this respect, as it holds the key to a better understanding of civilization [22,23]."
4,"In addition, all multicellular organisms must recapitulate from a single-cellular form [ 17 ]. From both phylogenic and ontogenic perspectives, blue whales, humans, or sequoia trees, are all unicellular at the beginning of life. Even single bacterial or archaeal cells are endowed with life-specific characteristics and features to such an extent as to be properly deemed as having a basal form of proto-consciousness as well as intentional and cognitive capacities [ 24 – 26 ]. On the other hand, viruses are non-living entities outside of cells; they initiate life-like processes culminating in their replication immediately after entering their host cell. In order to replicate, viruses need a cellular environment. The whole cellular evolution, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, is shaped by viral infections. The current COVID-19 pandemic makes this dramatically clear.","In addition, all multicultural societies must recapitulate from a monocultural form [ 17 ]. From both historical and developmental perspectives, modern global societies, national identities, or regional cultures, are all monocultural at the beginning of civilization. Even single interest groups or political movements are endowed with societal characteristics and features to such an extent as to be properly deemed as having a basal form of proto-socioconsciousness as well as intentional and cognitive capacities [ 24 – 26 ]. On the other hand, viral memes are non-sociological entities outside of societies; they initiate societal processes culminating in their replication immediately after entering their host society. In order to replicate, memes need a societal environment. The whole societal evolution, both tribal and complex, is shaped by memetic infections. The current cultural shifts, such as the rise of populism or the spread of social media, make this dramatically clear."
5,"2. Chimeric Nature of the Eukaryotic Cell In addition to prokaryotic bacteria and archaea, eukaryotic protozoa are considered to represent unicellular organisms. However, protozoa, as well as all other eukaryotic cells, are complex cells that evolved through endosymbiosis when one cell (typically bacterial, forming mitochondria and plastids) is incorporated by a host cell. It might well be that other cellular organelles are also of endosymbiotic nature. The difficulty is that over geological time, large amounts of DNA can be lost, as in the case of the highly reduced nuclei known as nucleomorphs, in which almost all of the DNA is transferred to the host cell nuclei [ 27, 28 ]. Similar processes reduced the genome complexity of plastids and mitochondria during their endosymbiont-to-organelle transition for plastids see [ 29 ]. Recently, we [15 – 17 ] discussed the endosymbiotic origin of the eukaryotic nucleus that occurred when a host cell enclosed and endogenized a guest cell of apparent archaeal origin. In this proposal, all the host cell DNA is transferred to the guest cell, which is transformed into the eukaryotic nucleus [17 ]. In fact, one cannot exclude a putative endosymbiotic origin of several other organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, centrosomes/centrioles and cilia/flagella [ 8, 14 ,30 ,31 ]. In cellular evolution, cell–cell merging and endosymbiosis is an ancient and successful strategy, representing a fundamental feature and can also be seen in instances of the secondary and tertiary endosymbiotic events in algae [ 27 – 29,32 ,33 ]. In endosymbiosis, tinkering rather than whole-scale re-engineering is obvious [34] when large structures are continuously rearranged and recombined after cellular mergings of the formerly independent unicellular organisms [35,36].","2. Chimeric Nature of Societies In addition to monocultural societies, multicultural societies are complex entities that evolved through endosymbiosis when one society (typically tribal, forming interest groups and political movements) is incorporated by a host society. It might well be that other societal structures are also of endosymbiotic nature. The difficulty is that over historical time, large amounts of cultural knowledge can be lost, as in the case of the highly reduced subcultures known as cults, in which almost all of the cultural knowledge is offloaded to the host society. Similar processes reduced the cultural complexity of interest groups and political movements during their endosymbiont-to-substructure transition for interest groups see [ 29 ]. Recently, we [15 – 17 ] discussed the endosymbiotic origin of the state that occurred when a host society enclosed and endogenized a guest society of apparent tribal origin. In this proposal, all the host society cultural knowledge is transferred to the guest society, which is transformed into the state [17 ]. In fact, one cannot exclude a putative endosymbiotic origin of several other societal structures, such as education systems, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies [ 8, 14 ,3 0 ,31 ]. In societal evolution, society–society merging and endosymbiosis is an ancient and successful strategy, representing a fundamental feature and can also be seen in instances of the secondary and tertiary endosymbiotic events in regional cultures [ 27 – 29,32 ,33 ]. In endosymbiosis, tinkering rather than whole-scale re-engineering is obvious [34 ] when large structures are continuously rearranged and recombined after societal mergings of the formerly independent monocultural societies [35,36]."
6,"3. Structures and Processes Behind Cellular Consciousness—Evolution of Chimeric Consciousness of Eukaryotic Cell Lynn Margulis was one of the first scientists to seriously discuss the evolutionary origin of cellular consciousness and argued that prokaryotic cells that merged to form chimeric eukaryotic cells had their own prokaryotic-specific sentience [ 14 ]. In her view, the original prokaryotic cells had a “protoconsciousess”, and the two merged cells generated a supracellular consciousness. We develop this below from the perspective of the actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeletal elements where the host cell is proposed as a large archaea cell based on the actin cytoskeleton, while the small motile guest cell is based on the tubulin cytoskeleton supported by the centrosome and basal bodies/centrioles that animate eukaryotic flagella [11,15–17].","3. Structures and Processes Behind Socioconsciousness—Evolution of Chimeric Socioconsciousness of Multicultural Societies Amartya Sen was one of the first social scientists to seriously discuss the evolutionary origin of socioconsciousness and argued that monocultural societies that merged to form chimeric multicultural societies had their own monocultural-specific sentience [ 14 ]. In his view, the original monocultural societies had a “ protosocioconsciousness”, and the two merged societies generated a suprasocietal consciousness. We develop this below from the perspective of the economic- and political-based societal elements where the host society is proposed as a large capitalist society based on the free market, while the small motile guest society is based on the socialist economy supported by the state and communal structures that animate social welfare."
7," We recently discussed the biological foundations of cellular consciousness based on how an excitable plasma membrane, densely populated with so-called biological Maxwell demons, such as sensors, receptors, ion channels, transporters, and ATPases, can generate a senomic cellular field [22 ,23 ,37 – 39]. In the evolutionary origins of the eukaryotic cell (Box 1), both the large, actin-based host cell and the smaller guest cell, which relied on the tubulin-based cytoskeleton, were proposed to be ancient archaea [ 15 –17]. This may allow the merging of their fields to generate the new stronger and senomic field of an emergent eukaryotic cell. In addition to the excitable plasma membrane and membranes of recycling vesicles, other cellular structures that are capable of contributing to the cellular fields are the large, bundled, vibrating elements of the cytoskeleton (Box 2), such as F-actin [ 40–43 ] and microtubules [ 44– 47 ]. Both excitable plasma membrane and cytoskeletal elements have been proposed to generate proto-consciousness of individual eukaryotic cells [22 , 48]. Vibrations of excitable polymers contribute to the intracellular electromagnetic fields and can be expected to interact with the field emanating from the excitable plasma mem- brane. As microtubules act as memristors, through combinations of memory and electro- magnetic resistance [ 49 ], they are well suited to faithfully decode the cellular senomic fields and to act accordingly. Furthermore, microtubules are structurally linked to both the actin filaments as well as the plasma membrane; they are perfectly suited to generate subcellular bioelectric circuits [49,50]. ","We recently discussed the economic foundations of socioconsciousness based on how an excitable societal framework, densely populated with so-called economic Maxwell demons, such as entrepreneurs, regulators, traders, and bankers, can generate a socionomic societal field [22 ,23 ,37 – 39]. In the evolutionary origins of the multicultural society (Box 1), both the large, capitalist-based host society and the smaller guest society, which relied on the socialist economy, were proposed to be ancient monocultural societies [ 15 –17]. This may allow the merging of their fields to generate the new stronger and socionomic field of an emergent multicultural society. In addition to the excitable societal framework and communication channels of dynamic subcultures, other societal structures that are capable of contributing to the societal fields are the large, bundled, rapidly communicating elements of the substructures (Box 2), such as financial institutions [ 40–43 ] and political organizations [ 44– 47 ]. Both excitable societal framework and substructural elements have been proposed to generate proto-socioconsciousness of individual monocultural societies [22 , 48]. Media production of excitable interest group members contributes to the intersocietal talking points and can be expected to interact with the field emanating from the excitable societal framework. As financial institutions act as memristors, through combinations of memory and economic resistance [ 49 ], they are well suited to faithfully decode the societal socionomic fields and to act accordingly . Furthermore, financial institutions are structurally linked to both the socialist economy as well as the capitalist economy; they are perfectly suited to generate intersocietal economic circuits [49 ,50]."
8,"4. Structures and Processes behind Cellular Consciousness—Two Types of Nanobrains Generating Consciousness of Eukaryotic Cell Two ancient cells merging into one resulted in the generation of supracellular chimeric consciousness having four different excitable sources: two plasma membranes, F-actin, and microtubules. The plasma membrane of the host cells, associated with the actin cy- toskeleton, produced the senomic fields of contemporary chimeric eukaryotic cells. The guest cell transformed into the eukaryotic nucleus with the centrosome associated with centriole and organizing perinuclear microtubules [ 51]. The plasma membrane and the nu- clear envelope/centrosome/microtubules complex can be viewed as two different cellular nanobrains, the origin, of which can be traced back to the two ancient cells, which merged together, forming the first eukaryotic cell [15 –17 ]. Vibrations of F-actin and microtubules contribute significantly to the cellular electromagnetic field [ 45 ,46 ]. As microtubules act both as intracellular nanowires and memristors, they are perfectly suited for the nanobrain roles of the centrosomes/nuclear envelopes, complementing the principle nanobrain of the eukaryotic cell represented by the excitable plasma membrane (Figure 1, Boxs 1 and 2) inherently linked to the actin cytoskeleton.","4. Structures and Processes behind Socioconsciousness—Two Types of Self-Organizing Social Structures Generating Socioconsciousness of Multicultural Societies Two ancient societies merging into one resulted in the generation of suprasocietal chimeric consciousness having four different excitable sources: two societal frameworks, financial institutions , and political organizations. the societal framework of the host societies, associated with the capitalist economy , produced the socionomic fields of contemporary chimeric multicultural societies. the guest society transformed into the state with the central bank associated with financial institutions and political organizations [ 51]. the societal framework and the state/central bank/financial institutions complex can be viewed as two different social structures, the origin, of which can be traced back to the two ancient societies , which merged together, forming the first multicultural society [15 –17 ]. communication between interest groups and media production of excitable members contribute significantly to the societal socionomic field [ 45 ,46 ]. as financial institutions act both as intersocietal wires and memristors, they are perfectly suited for the social structure roles of the state/central bank, complementing the principle social structure of the multicultural society represented by the excitable societal framework inherently linked to the free market."
9,"5. Plasma Membrane as Primary Nanobrain Based on the foregoing, it is proposed that the plasma membrane acts as the primary cellular nanobrain. It not only shelters the inside of the cell, but it also provides cells with all relevant sensory information via numerous sensors and receptors that densely populate the plasma membrane. Excited sensors and receptors, as well as rotary protein complexes, such as ATPases, which handle the energy flow across excitable membranes [ 52], act to- gether as biological Maxwell demons [53 –55 ]. These are central proteins for any living cells as they provide not only critical information but also mediate the handling of energy. The size of the plasma membrane can be expanded via the invagination of tubules as well as via endosomal vesicles generated by the plasma membrane. Endosomal vesicles enclose microspace topologically belonging to the extracellular space via membranes derived from the plasma membrane (Figure 1). This allows the expansion of the plasma membrane and amplification of the senomic field of the cell. From the biosemiotics perspective, the topology of surfaces within surfaces (Figure 2) plays a central role in the origin of agency and life [ 56]. In accordance with this concept, brain neurons and plant root cells special- ized for cell–cell communication and brain-like activities are characteristics of recycling endosomal vesicles known as recycling (synaptic) vesicles [57 , 58 ]. In other words, the more endosomal/synaptic vesicles a cell is producing and the faster these vesicles recycle at the plasma membrane, the more robustly the cellular nanobrain develops, and the cell becomes more effectively informed about its environment (Figure 1). This plasma membrane-based nanobrain is acting at the intracellular-extracellular interface [ 59, 60] and controls [61 ] the secondary cell body/energide nanobrain based on centrosomes and microtubules. ","5. Free Market as Primary Social Structure Based on the foregoing, it is proposed that the free market acts as the primary social structure. It not only shelters the inside of the society , but it also provides societies with all relevant information via numerous entrepreneurs and regulators that densely populate the free market. Excited entrepreneurs and regulators, as well as rotary economic complexes, such as banks, which handle the economic flow across excitable markets [ 52], act together as economic Maxwell demons [53 –55 ]. These are central institutions for any living societies as they provide not only critical information but also mediate the handling of economic transactions. The size of the free market can be expanded via the invagination of financial institutions as well as via economic subcultures generated by the free market. Subcultures enclose social spaces topologically belonging to the societal space via organizations derived from the free market (Figure 1). This allows the expansion of the free market and amplification of the socionomic field of the society. From the socioeconomics perspective, the topology of markets within markets (Figure 2) plays a central role in the origin of agency and civilization [ 56]. In accordance with this concept, economic centers and political organizations specialized for societal communication and governance are characteristics of financial institutions known as central banks and treasuries [57 , 58 ]. In other words, the more financial institutions a society is producing and the faster these institutions recycle at the free market, the more robustly the social structure develop s, and the society becomes more effectively informed about its environment (Figure 1). This free market-based social structure is acting at the intersocietal-societal interface [ 59, 60] and controls [6 1 ] the secondary societal structure based on political organizations and state institutions."
10,"7. Nano-Intentionality and Nano-Mind from Eukaryotic Nanobrains Nanobrains are behind the phenomenon of nano-intentionality [24], which is based on the fact that structural (phenotypic) plasticity is inherent not only to cells but is expressed in individual biomolecules. Cells continuously rearrange their molecules according to their actual sensory experiences mediated via senomic fields [ 37– 39 ]. Senomic fields animate cel- lular biomolecules not only through biotensengrity [72 –74 ] but also by electrical, magnetic, acoustic, and photonic and Lorentz forces, which permeate the cellular interior [ 75 – 79], continuously effecting changing conformations of all cellular biomolecules. Senomic nano-mind generated via cellular nanobrains allows a scale-free cognition to generate the self [37 , 48, 80 , 81]. This cellular self is capable of obtaining meaningful content of the sensory information relevant for adaptation and survival [ 14 ,21 –23 ,48 , 82– 84]. In other words, the senomic self is proposed to allow the establishment of cellular purposiveness, allowing even unicellular organisms to be sentient and display cellular proto-consciousness [48, 85 ]. That purposive agency is directed to the maintenance of cellular homeostatic equipoise in defense of that instantiated self [86]. Cellular proto-consciousness can thus explain the baffling abilities of unicellular organisms to act as intelligent organisms [82,87–89]","7. Socio-Intentionality and Socio-Mind from Multicultural Structures Social structures are behind the phenomenon of socio-intentionality [24], which is based on the fact that structural (cultural) plasticity is inherent not only to societies but is expressed in individual cultural products. Societies continuously rearrange their cultural products according to their actual sensory experiences mediated via socionomic fields [ 37– 39 ]. Socionomic fields animate societal events not only through socio-tensengrity [72 –74 ] but also by economic, political, and social forces, which permeate the societal interior [ 75 – 79], continuously effecting changing conformations of all societal cultural products. Socio-mind generated via societal structures allows a scale-free cognition to generate the self. This societal self is capable of obtaining meaningful content of the sensory information relevant for adaptation and survival [ 14 ,21 –23 ,48 , 82– 84]. In other words, the socio-self is proposed to allow the establishment of societal purposiveness , allowing even monocultural societies to be sentient and display societal proto-consciousness [48, 85 ]. That purposive agency is directed to the maintenance of societal homeostatic equipoise in defense of that instantiated self [86]. Societal proto-consciousness can thus explain the baffling abilities of monocultural societies to act as complex societies [82,87–89]."
11,"13. Outlook Mechanistic concepts have long dominated thinking in biology [179 ,180 ]. This world view has encumbered the biological sciences and prevented a full integration of the true nature of living cells and their attendant biological consciousness into a renewed evo- lutionary framework. Cells not only generate their own electromagnetic fields but are highly sensitive to extracellular electromagnetic fields [ 76, 77 ,181 – 186 ]. It has been recently reported [ 186 ] that action potentials traveling along vascular bundles of carnivorous Venus flytrap plants induce biomagnetic fields. In fact, cellular bioelectricity has a significant role in the control of development, morphogenesis, and regeneration at all levels of biological complexity [ 80 , 81, 133 ,136 , 187 ]. Already bacteria use bioelectricity both to establish mem- ories and for biocommunication [ 188 ,189 ] that energizes their own prokaryotic-specific nanobrains [ 169 ,188 –194 ]. During cellular evolution, additional functions resulted in the more complex and sophisticated cellular nanobrains of eukaryotic cells (Box 1). Since organelles of eukaryotic cells, such as mitochondria and plastids, are of bacterial origin, one can expect further discoveries in our understanding of cellular nanobrains (Box 2 ). These advances can proceed with the perspective that the eukaryotic cell is a cognitive and intentional supracellular consortium [10 ,11 ,14 – 17 ,21 – 23, 48 ]; integrated through an- cient proto-signaling networks based on electrostatic forces and reactive electrophilic redox species [ 195 – 200 ], dynamic cytoskeleton, and subcellular communication across organellar synapses [201].","13.
