Lets continue with the translation then. We can perhaps be more liberal with the conclusions and add some more of these thoughts in there.%0A%0AUSER %5BQ: CS -%3E SOCIOLOGY%5D, Over the last year, diffusion based text-to-image models%0Ahave taken the Internet by storm, growing from research%0Aprojects to numerous applications in advertising, fashion %5B1,%0A2%5D, web development %5B3, 4, 5%5D, and AI art %5B6, 7, 8, 9%5D.%0AModels like Stable Diffusion SDXL, Midjourney v5, Dalle-%0A3, Imagen, Adobe Firefly and others boast tens of millions of%0Aregistered users and have produced billions of images %5B10%5D.%0ADespite their significant and disruptive impact on busi-%0Aness and creative industries, few have considered the vul-%0Anerability of diffusion models to data poisoning attacks.%0APoisoning attacks manipulate training data to introduce%0Aunexpected behavior to the model at training time. They%0Ahave been studied extensively in the context of classification%0Atasks using deep neural networks (DNN). Poisoning attacks%0Acause predictable misclassifications, but typically demand a%0Asubstantial volume of poison data for success, e.g., ratio of%0Apoison training samples to benign samples of 20%25 or higher.%0ASince today%E2%80%99s diffusion models are trained on hundreds of%0Amillions (or billions) of images, a common assumption is%0Athat poisoning attacks on these models would require mil-%0Alions of poison samples, making them infeasible in practice.%0A%0AIn this work, we demonstrate a surprising result: state-%0Aof-the-art text-to-image models are in fact highly vulnerable%0Ato data poisoning attacks. Our work is based on two key%0Ainsights. First, while these models are trained on millions%0Aand billions of images, the number of training samples%0Aassociated with a specific concept or prompt is quite low,%0Aon the order of thousands. We call this property %E2%80%9Cconcept%0Asparsity,%E2%80%9D and it suggests the viability of prompt-specific%0Apoisoning attacks that corrupt a model%E2%80%99s ability to respond%0Ato specific targeted prompts. Second, we observe that nat-%0Aural benign images exhibit large variance in text labels,%0Aimage composition, and image features, all of which produce%0Adestructive interference to minimize training influence. By%0Acrafting poison samples that minimize these sources of%0Ainterference, we can produce highly effective poison attacks%0Awith very few samples. Unlike previous work on backdoor%0Aattacks %5B11, 12, 13%5D, we show that successful prompt-specific%0Apoisoning attacks do not require access to the model internal%0Apipeline, and only need a very small number of poison%0Asamples to override a specific target prompt.

They\nhave been studied extensively in the context of classification\ntasks using deep neural networks (DNN). Poisoning attacks\ncause predictable misclassifications, but typically demand a\nsubstantial volume of poison data for success, e.g., ratio of\npoison training samples to benign samples of 20% or higher.\nSince today’s diffusion models are trained on hundreds of\nmillions (or billions) of images, a common assumption is\nthat poisoning attacks on these models would require mil-\nlions of poison samples, making them infeasible in practice.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate a surprising result: state-\nof-the-art text-to-image models are in fact highly vulnerable\nto data poisoning attacks.

We found this approach\nineffective on detecting Nightshade poison data, achieving\n73% precision and 47% recall with 10% FPR. Removing\nall the detected data points prior to training the model only\nreduces Nightshade attack success rate by < 5% because\nit will remove less than half of the poison samples on\naverage, but the remaining 159 poison samples are more\nthan sufficient to achieve attack success (see Figure 10).\nThe low detection performance is because benign samples\nin large text/image datasets is often extremely diverse and\nnoisy, and a significant portion of it produces high loss,\nleading to high false positive rate of 10%. Since benign\noutliers tend to play a critical role in improving generation\nfor border cases [91], removing these false positives (high\nloss benign data) would likely have a significant negative\nimpact on model performance.\n\nPROTEUS [T: CS -> SOCIOLOGY], \n\nPROTEUS [T: CS -> SOCIOLOGY],"]],"start1":29129,"start2":29129,"length1":4,"length2":2484}],"parent":"5e99ede6-9980-41f0-8ffe-88a53ef96998","type":"human","bookmarked":false,"hidden":false,"createdAt":1709569687658},"ad069a79-e7c5-4476-9db4-1d765d1b55da":{"id":"ad069a79-e7c5-4476-9db4-1d765d1b55da","text":"@@ -31586,28 +31586,333 @@\n ROTEUS %5BT: CS -%3E SOCIOLOGY%5D,\n+ 7.
