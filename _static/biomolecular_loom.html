Let's stick with that for now, and translate some more.\n\nUSER [T"],[1,"Very nice. Lets go through some more of the paper.\n\nUSER [T: MOLBIO -> SOCIOLOGY], 1. Cellular Nature of Life\nNobel Prize winner Sir Paul Nurse in his latest book, What is Life? laments that we\nare underestimating cells [1]. He notes that every cell is a living entity endowed with\nall the properties that characterize living organisms. Unfortunately, the original form\nof Cell Theory, as postulated more than a hundred years ago, is plagued with several\nconceptual problems [2– 5]. It is often ignored or forgotten that eukaryotic cells can, in fact,\nbe viewed as multicellular ecosystems, in effect “cells within cells” [6,7 ]. Their organelles,\nsuch as mitochondria and plastids, are semi-autonomous endosymbiotic cells [ 8–13 ]. The\nsymbiotic origin of the nucleus is emerging as a highly plausible scenario [ 9,14 –17 ]. Cell\ntheory has been an important concept unifying the whole of biology and has played a\ncentral role in our understanding of life [ 1,18 –20 ]. However, several aspects of the theory\nrequire attention and amendment. A model based on biomolecular mechanisms of cellular\nconsciousness [14,21,22] is a prime candidate in this respect, as it holds the key to a better\nunderstanding of life [22,23]."]],"start1":10025,"start2":10025,"length1":89,"length2":1225}],"parent":156,"type":"human"},"162":{"id":162,"text":"@@ -11243,8 +11243,157 @@\n %5B22,23%5D.\n+ %0A%0APROTEUS %5BT: MOLBIO -%3E SOCIOLOGY%5D, 1.
