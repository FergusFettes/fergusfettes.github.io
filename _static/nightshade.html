1,"Prompt-Specific Poisoning Attacks on Text-to-Image Generative Models","Concept-Specific Poisoning Attacks on Human Discourse"
2,"Trained on billions of images, diffusion-based text- to-image models seem impervious to traditional data poisoning attacks, which typically require poison samples approaching 20% of the training set. In this paper, we demonstrate the surprising result that state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models are in fact highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Our work is driven by two key insights. First, while diffusion models are trained on millions and billions of samples, the number of training samples associated with a specific concept or prompt is generally on the order of thousands. This suggests that these models will be vulnerable to prompt-specific poisoning attacks that corrupt a model’s ability to respond to specific targeted prompts. Second, poison samples can be carefully crafted to maximize poison potency to ensure success with very few samples. We introduce Nightshade, a prompt-specific poisoning at- tack optimized for potency that can completely control the output of a prompt in Stable Diffusion’s newest model (SDXL) with less than 100 poisoned training samples. Nightshade also generates stealthy poison images that look visually identical to their benign counterparts, and produces poison effects that “bleed through” to related concepts. More importantly, a moderate number of Nightshade attacks on independent prompts can destabilize a model and disable its ability to generate images for any and all prompts. Finally, we propose the use of Nightshade and similar tools as a defense for content owners against web scrapers that ignore opt-out/do-not-crawl directives, and discuss potential implications for both model trainers and content owners.","Trained on a lifetime of multimedia content, humans seem impervious to traditional data poisoning attacks, which typically require poison samples approaching 20% of the training set.

3,"Over the last year, diffusion based text-to-image models have taken the Internet by storm, growing from research projects to numerous applications in advertising, fashion [1, 2], web development [3, 4, 5], and AI art [6, 7, 8, 9]. Models like Stable Diffusion SDXL, Midjourney v5, Dalle- 3, Imagen, Adobe Firefly and others boast tens of millions of registered users and have produced billions of images [10]. Despite their significant and disruptive impact on busi- ness and creative industries, few have considered the vul- nerability of diffusion models to data poisoning attacks. Poisoning attacks manipulate training data to introduce unexpected behavior to the model at training time. They have been studied extensively in the context of classification tasks using deep neural networks (DNN). Poisoning attacks cause predictable misclassifications, but typically demand a substantial volume of poison data for success, e.g., ratio of poison training samples to benign samples of 20% or higher. Since today’s diffusion models are trained on hundreds of millions (or billions) of images, a common assumption is that poisoning attacks on these models would require mil- lions of poison samples, making them infeasible in practice. In this work, we demonstrate a surprising result: state- of-the-art text-to-image models are in fact highly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Our work is based on two key insights. First, while these models are trained on millions and billions of images, the number of training samples associated with a specific concept or prompt is quite low, on the order of thousands. We call this property “concept sparsity,” and it suggests the viability of prompt-specific poisoning attacks that corrupt a model’s ability to respond to specific targeted prompts. Second, we observe that nat- ural benign images exhibit large variance in text labels, image composition, and image features, all of which produce destructive interference to minimize training influence. By crafting poison samples that minimize these sources of interference, we can produce highly effective poison attacks with very few samples. Unlike previous work on backdoor attacks [11, 12, 13], we show that successful prompt-specific poisoning attacks do not require access to the model internal pipeline, and only need a very small number of poison samples to override a specific target prompt. For example, a single Nightshade attack (“car” to “cow”) targeting Stable Diffusion SDXL has a high probability of success using only 50 optimized samples, and the poisoned model outputs an image of a cow for every mention of a car in its prompts.","Over the past few decades, the internet and multimedia content have revolutionized human communication and information consumption, influencing advertising, fashion, web development, and even art. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and others boast billions of users and have facilitated the exchange of trillions of pieces of content. Despite their significant impact on society and culture, few have considered the vulnerability of human cognition to data poisoning attacks. Poisoning attacks manipulate the information environment to introduce unexpected behaviors in human cognition at the time of exposure. They have been studied extensively in the context of political persuasion, advertising, and propaganda. These attacks cause predictable misconceptions or biases, but typically demand a substantial volume of poisoned information for success, e.g., a ratio of poisoned content to benign content of 20% or higher. Since humans are exposed to a vast amount of information from various sources, a common assumption is that poisoning attacks on human cognition would require an overwhelming amount of poisoned content, making them infeasible in practice. In this work, we demonstrate a surprising result: human cognition is in fact highly vulnerable to data data poisoning attacks. Our work is based on two key insights. First, while humans are exposed to a vast amount of information, the number of samples associated with a specific concept or idea is quite low, on the order of thousands. We call this property “concept sparsity,” and it suggests the viability of concept-specific poisoning attacks that corrupt a person's ability to respond to specific targeted ideas. Second, we observe that natural benign information exhibits large variance in narratives, contexts, and features, all of which produce destructive interference to minimize cognitive influence. By crafting poison samples that minimize these sources of interference, we can produce highly effective poison attacks with very few samples. Unlike previous work on cognitive biases and manipulation, we show that successful concept-specific poisoning attacks do not require access to a person's internal thought processes, and only need a very small number of poison samples to override a specific target concept. For example, a single Nightshade attack ("democracy" to "tyranny") targeting an individual's understanding has a high probability of success using only a few carefully carefully crafted samples, and the poisoned individual will interpret every mention of democracy as a reference to tyranny."
4,"This paper describes our experiences and findings in designing and evaluating prompt-specific poisoning attacks against generative text-to-image models. First, we validate our hypothesis of “concept sparsity” in existing large-scale datasets used to train generative image models. We find that as hypothesized, concepts in popular training datasets like LAION-Aesthetic exhibit very low training data density, both in terms of concept sparsity (# of training samples associated explicitly with a specific concept) and semantic sparsity (# of samples associated with a concept and its semantically related terms). Second, we confirm a proof of concept poisoning attack (by mislabeling images) can successfully corrupt image generation for specific concepts (e.g., “dog”) using 500-1000 poison samples. Successful attacks on Stable Diffusion’s newest model (SDXL) are con- firmed using both CLIP-based classification and an (IRB- approved) user study. Unfortunately this attack still requires too many poison samples and is easily detected/filtered. Third, we propose a highly optimized prompt-specific poisoning attack we call Nightshade. Nightshade uses mul- tiple optimization techniques (including targeted adversarial perturbations) to generate stealthy and highly effective poi- son samples, with four observable benefits.","This paper describes our experiences and findings in designing and evaluating concept-specific poisoning attacks against human cognition.

5,"1) Nightshade poison samples are benign images shifted in the feature space, and still look like their benign counterparts to the human eye. They avoid detection through human inspection and prompt generation. 2) Nightshade samples produce stronger poisoning effects, enabling highly successful poisoning attacks with very few (e.g., 100) samples. 3) Nightshade’s poisoning effects “bleed through” to re- lated concepts, and thus cannot be circumvented by prompt replacement. For example, Nightshade sam- ples poisoning “fantasy art” also affect “dragon” and “Michael Whelan” (a well-known fantasy and SciFi artist). Nightshade attacks are composable, e.g. a single prompt can trigger multiple poisoned prompts. 4) When many independent Nightshade attacks affect dif- ferent prompts on a single model (e.g., 250 attacks on SDXL), the model’s understanding of basic features becomes corrupted and it is no longer able to generate meaningful images.","Nightshade poison samples are carefully crafted narratives or pieces of information that, while appearing benign or consistent with expected norms, subtly shift the conceptual understanding in the human mind. They avoid detection through casual observation and critical analysis. 2) Nightshade samples produce stronger poisoning effects, enabling highly successful poisoning attacks with very few (e.g., 100) samples. 3) Nightshade’s poisoning effects “bleed through” to related concepts, and thus cannot be circumvented by simply avoiding specific topics. For example, Nightshade samples poisoning the concept of “freedom” might also affect related concepts like “democracy” and “rights.” 4) When many independent Nightshade attacks affect different concepts within a person's understanding (e.g., 250 attacks on a person's understanding of the world), the person's ability to reason and make sense of information becomes corrupted and they are no longer able to engage in meaningful discourse or decision-making."
6,"We also observe that Nightshade exhibits strong transfer- ability across models and can resist a spectrum of defenses intended to deter current poisoning attacks. Finally, we propose the use of Nightshade as a powerful tool for content owners to protect their intellectual property. Today, content owners can only rely on opt-out lists and do- not-scrape/crawl directives, tools that are not enforceable or verifiable, and easily ignored by any model trainer. Movie studios, book publishers, game producers and individual artists can use systems like Nightshade to provide a strong disincentive against unauthorized data training. We discuss current deployment plans, benefits and implications in §8. Note that Nightshade differs substantially from recent tools that disrupt image style mimicry attacks such as Glaze [14] or Mist [15]. These tools seek to prevent home users from fine-tuning their local copies of models on 10- 20 images from a single artist, and they assume a majority of the training images have been protected by the tool. In contrast, Nightshade seeks to corrupt the base model, such that its behavior will be altered for all users.","We also observe that Nightshade exhibits strong transferability across different social contexts and can resist a spectrum of countermeasures intended to deter current misinformation campaigns. Finally, we propose the use of Nightshade as a powerful tool for communities and activists to protect cultural narratives and public discourse. Today, individuals and communities can only rely on appeals to platform moderation and ethical journalism, tools that are not always enforceable or effective, and easily bypassed by sophisticated misinformation campaigns. Activist groups, cultural institutions, and concerned citizens can use strategies like Nightshade to provide a strong disincentive against the manipulation of public opinion and cultural narratives. We discuss current deployment plans, benefits, and implications in this paper. Note that Nightshade differs substantially from recent initiatives aimed at combating fake news or misinformation, such as fact-checking services or media literacy campaigns. These efforts often target the symptoms of misinformation, while Nightshade aims to fortify the cognitive resilience of individuals, making them less susceptible to manipulation. In contrast to approaches that seek to filter or remove harmful content after it has been disseminated, Nightshade seeks to preemptively inoculate the public discourse, ensuring that the foundational understanding of critical issues remains untainted and robust against deliberate attempts at distortion."
7,"6.5. Stacking Multiple Nightshade Attacks Given the wide deployment of generative image models today, it is not unrealistic to imagine that a single model might come under attack by multiple entities targeting com- pletely unrelated concepts with poison attacks. Here, we consider the potential aggregate impact of multiple inde- pendent attacks. First, we show results on composability of poison attacks. Second, we show surprising result, a sufficient number of attacks can actually destabilize the entire model, effectively disabling the model’s ability to generate responses to completely unrelated prompts. Poison attacks are composable. Given our discussion on model sparsity (§3.2), it is not surprising that multiple poison attack targeting different poisoned concepts can co- exist in a model without interference. In fact, when we test prompts that trigger multiple poisoned concepts, we find that poison effects are indeed composable. Figure 16 shows images generated from a poisoned model where attackers poison “dog” to “cat” and “fantasy art” to “impressionism” with 100 poison samples each. When prompted with text that contains both “dog” and “fantasy art”, the model generates images that combine both destination concepts, i.e. a cat in an impressionism-like style.","6.5.

Here, we consider the potential aggregate impact of multiple independent attacks. First, we show results on composability of misinformation campaigns. Second, we show surprising result, a sufficient number of attacks can actually destabilize the entire platform or discourse, effectively disabling the platform's or discourse's ability to generate coherent and unbiased narratives. Misinformation campaigns are composable. Given our discussion on concept sparsity, it is not surprising that multiple misinformation attacks targeting different poisoned concepts can co-exist in a discourse without interference. In fact, when we test narratives that trigger multiple poisoned concepts, we find that misinformation effects are indeed composable. This demonstrates that attacks on “freedom” to “control” and “democracy” to “authoritarianism” with carefully crafted narratives can coexist within a discourse. When confronted with discussions that involve both “freedom” and “democracy,” the discourse becomes muddled, leading to a narrative that combines both distorted concepts, i.e., an authoritarian control disguised as freedom."
8,"Multiple attacks damage the entire model. Today’s text- to-image diffusion models relies on hierarchical or stepwise approach to generate high quality images [19, 24, 26, 84]. They often first generate high-level coarse features (e.g., a medium size animal) and then refine them slowly into high quality images of specific content (e.g., a dog). As a result, models learn not only content-specific information from training data but also high-level coarse features. Poison data targeting specific concepts might have lasting impact on these high level coarse features, e.g., poisoning fantasy art will slightly degrade model’s performance on all artwork. Hence, it is possible that a considerable number of attacks can largely degrade a model’s overall performance. We test this hypothesis by gradually increasing the num- ber of Nightshade attacks on a single model and evaluating its performance. We follow prior work on text-to-image generation [19, 26, 37, 85] and leverage two popular metrics to evaluate generative model’s overall performance: 1) CLIP alignment score which captures generated image’s alignment to its prompt [68], and 2) FID score which captures image quality [86]. We randomly sample a number of concepts (nouns) from the training dataset and inject 100 poison samples to attack each concept. We find that as more concepts are poisoned, the model’s overall performance drop dramatically: alignment score < 0.24 and FID > 39.6 when 250 different concepts are poisoned with 100 samples each. Based on these metrics, the resulting model performs worse than a GAN-based model from 2017 [87], and close to that of a model that outputs random noise (Table 4). Figure 17 illustrates the impact of these attacks with example images generated on prompts not targeted by any poison attacks. We include two generic prompts (“a person” and “a painting”) and a more specific prompt (“seashell,” which is far away from most other concepts in text embed- ding space (see Appendix Figure 18). Image quality starts to degrade noticeably with 250 concepts poisoned, When 500 to 1000 concepts are poisoned, the model generates what seems like random noise. For a model training from scratch (LD-CC), similar levels of degradation requires 500 concepts to be poisoned (Table 9 in Appendix). While we have reproduced this result for a variety of parameters and conditions, we do not yet fully understand the theoretical cause for this observed behavior, and leave further analysis of its cause to future work.","Multiple attacks damage the entire discourse. Today's information environments rely on a hierarchical or stepwise approach to shape public opinion and understanding, often first introducing broad concepts (e.g., freedom) and then refining them into more specific narratives (e.g., democracy). As a result, platforms and discourses learn not only concept-specific information from their sources, but also high-level coarse features. Misinformation campaigns targeting specific concepts might have a lasting impact on these high-level coarse features, e.g., poisoning the concept of "freedom" will slightly degrade the discourse's performance on all related concepts. Hence, it is possible that a considerable number of attacks can largely degrade a discourse's overall coherence and trustworthiness. We test this hypothesis by gradually increasing the number of Nightshade attacks on a single platform or discourse and evaluating its performance. We follow prior work on public discourse analysis [19, 26, 37, 85] and leverage two popular metrics to evaluate a discourse's overall performance: 1) inter-narrative coherence, which captures the consistency and logical flow of narratives within the discourse, and 2) trustworthiness, which captures the discourse's credibility and reliability in the eyes of the public. We randomly select a number of concepts (topics) from the discourse and inject carefully crafted misinformation to attack each concept. We find that as more concepts are poisoned, the discourse's overall performance drops dramatically: inter-narrative coherence decreases, indicating a fragmented and contradictory set of narratives, and trustworthiness plummets, reflecting a loss of public confidence in the information provided. The resulting discourse becomes akin to one dominated by conspiracy theories, where coherence is low and misinformation is rampant. This demonstrates the potential for widespread misinformation campaigns to not only target specific concepts but to also fundamentally undermine the integrity of public discourse as a whole. Figure 17 illustrates the impact of these attacks with example narratives generated on topics not targeted by any misinformation campaigns. We include two generic topics (“human rights” and “the economy”) and a more specific topic (“climate change,” which is far away from most other topics in the semantic embedding space). Narrative coherence starts to degrade noticeably with 250 topics poisoned, When 500 to 1000 topics are poisoned, the discourse generates what seems like random noise, with narratives that are incoherent and devoid of any meaningful content. While we have reproduced this result for a variety of parameters and conditions, we do not yet fully understand the theoretical cause for this observed behavior, and leave further analysis of its cause to future work."
9,"7. Potential Defenses We consider potential defenses that model trainers could deploy to reduce the effectiveness of prompt-specific poison attacks. We assume model trainers have access to the poison generation method and access to the surrogate model used to construct poison samples. While many detection/defense methods have been pro- posed to detect poison in classifiers, recent work shows they are often unable to extend to or are ineffective in genera- tive models (LLMs and multimodal models) [58, 60, 90]. Because benign training datasets for generative models are larger, more diverse, and less structured (no discrete labels), it is easier for poison data to hide in the training set. Here, we design and evaluate Nightshade against 3 poison detection methods and 1 poison removal method. For each experiment, we generate 300 poison samples for each of the poisoned concepts, including both objects and styles. We report both precision and recall for defense that detect poison data, as well as impact on attack performance when model trainer filters out any data detected as poison. We test both a training-from-scratch scenario (LD-CC) and a continuous training scenario (SD-XL). Filtering high loss data. Poison data is designed to incur high loss during model training. Leveraging this observation, one defensive approach is to filter out any data that has abnormally high loss. A model trainer can calculate the training loss of each data and filter out ones with highest loss (using a clean pretrained model). We found this approach ineffective on detecting Nightshade poison data, achieving 73% precision and 47% recall with 10% FPR. Removing all the detected data points prior to training the model only reduces Nightshade attack success rate by < 5% because it will remove less than half of the poison samples on average, but the remaining 159 poison samples are more than sufficient to achieve attack success (see Figure 10). The low detection performance is because benign samples in large text/image datasets is often extremely diverse and noisy, and a significant portion of it produces high loss, leading to high false positive rate of 10%. Since benign outliers tend to play a critical role in improving generation for border cases [91], removing these false positives (high loss benign data) would likely have a significant negative impact on model performance.","7. Potential Defenses We consider potential defenses that individuals and communities could deploy to reduce the effectiveness of concept-specific poison attacks. We assume that individuals have an understanding of the tactics used in misinformation campaigns and access to educational resources designed to foster critical thinking and resilience against manipulation. While many detection/defense methods have been proposed to counter misinformation and cognitive biases, recent work shows they are often unable to extend to or are ineffective in complex information environments. Because the information landscape is larger, more diverse, and less structured (no discrete labels), it is easier for misinformation to hide within the vast amount of available content. Here, we design and evaluate Nightshade against 3 misinformation detection methods and 1 misinformation removal method. For each experiment, we generate 300 misinformation narratives for each of the poisoned concepts, including both factual topics and opinions. We report both precision and recall for defenses that detect misinformation, as well as impact on attack performance when individuals filter out any content detected as misinformation. We test both a scenario where individuals are exposed to misinformation for the first time (LD-CC) and a scenario where individuals are continuously exposed to misinformation (SD-XL). Filtering high loss data. Misinformation narratives are designed to incur high cognitive dissonance during information processing. Leveraging this observation, one defensive approach is to filter out any content that generates abnormally high cognitive dissonance. Individuals can learn to recognize the signs of cognitive dissonance and avoid or critically evaluate information that triggers it. This method was found to be somewhat effective in reducing the impact of Nightshade misinformation narratives, achieving moderate success in identifying and mitigating misinformation. However, because misinformation can be subtle and mimic benign information closely, this approach alone is not fully effective in preventing the spread and impact of poisoned narratives. The challenge lies in the diverse and nuanced nature of information consumption, where significant portions of complex or challenging content might also induce cognitive dissonance, leading to potential false positives and missed detection of actual misinformation."
10,"9. Conclusion This work demonstrates the design and practical fea- sibility of prompt-specific poison attacks on text-to-image generative models. As a first step in this direction, our results shed light on fundamental limitations of these generative models, and suggest that even more powerful attacks might be possible. Nightshade and future work in this space may have potential value as tools to encourage model trainers and content owners to negotiate a path towards licensed procurement of training data for future models.","9. Conclusion This work demonstrates the design and practical feasibility of concept-specific poison attacks on human cognition. As a pioneering exploration in this direction, our findings illuminate fundamental vulnerabilities in how individuals process information and suggest that even more potent forms of manipulation might be possible. Nightshade and future endeavors in this space could serve as crucial instruments for encouraging a dialogue among educators, policymakers, and the general public about fostering resilience against misinformation and developing strategies for the ethical management and dissemination of information. By highlighting these vulnerabilities, we hope to pave the way for more robust defenses against manipulation, ultimately contributing to a more informed and resilient society."
