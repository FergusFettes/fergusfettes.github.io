1,"Prion Diseases of Humans and Animals: Their Causes and Molecular Basis","Deviant-Synonym Diseases in Minds and Cultures: Their Causes and Linguistic Basis"
2,"Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative conditions that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie in animals. Prions appear to be composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of a host-encoded glycoprotein, prion protein. Prion propagation involves recruitment of host cellular prion protein, composed primarily of α-helical structure, into a disease specific isoform rich in β-sheet structure. The existence of multiple prion strains has been difficult to explain in terms of a protein-only infections agent, but recent studies suggest that strain specific phenotypes can be encoded by different prion protein conformations and glycosylation patterns. The ability of a protein to encode phenotypic information has important biological implications. The appearance of a novel human prion disease, variant CJD, and the clear experimental evidence that it is caused by exposure to BSE has highlighted the need to understand the molecular basis of prion propagation, pathogenesis, and the barriers limiting intermammalian transmission. It is unclear if a large epidemic of variant CJD will occur in the years ahead.","Deviant-synonym diseases are transmissible cognitive degenerative conditions that include Semantic Drift Disorder (SDD) in individuals and Memetic Mutation Syndrome (MMS) and Lexical Corruption Disease (LCD) in cultures. Deviant synonyms appear to be composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of a host-encoded term, the original meaning. Deviant-synonym propagation involves recruitment of the host's conventional understanding of a term, composed primarily of a stable, commonly accepted structure, into a disease-specific isoform rich in ambiguous or context-dependent interpretation. The existence of multiple deviant-synonym strains has been difficult to explain in terms of a purely word-based infectious agent, but recent studies suggest that strain-specific phenotypes can be encoded by different word or phrase conformations and contextual patterns. The ability of a word or phrase to encode phenotypic information has important linguistic implications. The appearance of a novel human deviant-synonym disease, Neologistic Semantic Drift (NSD), and the clear experimental evidence that it is caused by exposure to MMS has highlighted the need to understand the linguistic basis of deviant-synonym propagation, pathogenesis, and the barriers limiting inter-cultural transmission. It is unclear if a large epidemic of NSD will occur in the years ahead."
3,"INTRODUCTION Historical Background The prion diseases are a closely related group of neurodegenerative conditions that affect both humans and animals. They have previously been described as subacute spongiform encephalopathies, slow virus diseases, and transmissible dementias. The prototypic disease is scrapie, a naturally occurring disease affecting sheep and goats. Scrapie has been recognized in Europe for over 200 years (McGowan 1922) and is present in many countries worldwide. More recently recognized animal diseases include transmissible mink encephalopathy (Marsh 1992), chronic wasting disease of mule deer and elk (Williams & Young 1980), and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (Wells et al 1987). The more recently described feline spongiform encephalopathy of domestic cats (Wyatt et al 1991) and spongiform encephalopathies of a number of zoo animals (Jeffrey & Wells 1988, Kirkwood et al 1990) are also recognized as animal prion diseases. Traditionally, human prion diseases have been classified into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome (GSS) (also known as GerstmannSträussler-Scheinker disease), and kuru. Although rare neurodegenerative disorders, affecting per annum about one person per million worldwide, these diseases have had remarkable attention focused on them recently. This is because of the unique biology of the transmissible agent or prion, and also because of fears that through dietary exposure to infected tissues, an epidemic of a newly recognized bovine prion disease, (BSE,) could pose a threat to public health.","INTRODUCTION Historical Background The deviant-synonym diseases are a closely related group of cognitive degenerative conditions that affect both individuals and cultures. They have previously been described as subacute semantic drift disorders, slow meme diseases, and transmissible language degradation. The prototypic disease is Lexical Corruption Disease (LCD), a naturally occurring disease affecting isolated communities and subcultures. LCD has been recognized in various parts of the world for over 200 years (McGowan 1922) and is present in many countries worldwide. More recently recognized cultural diseases include Memetic Mutation Syndrome (MMS) (Marsh 1992), Semantic Decay Disorder (SDD) of online communities and forums (Williams & Young 1980), and Neologistic Semantic Drift (NSD) (Wells et al 1987). The more recently described Syntactic Degradation Disease (SDD) of social media (Wyatt et al 1991) and semantic drift disorders of a number of subcultures (Jeffrey & Wells 1988, Kirkwood et al 1990) are also recognized as deviant-synonym diseases. Traditionally, human deviant-synonym diseases have been classified into Semantic Drift Disorder (SDD), Lexical Ambiguity Syndrome (LAS) (also known as Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease), and Linguistic Entropy Disease (LED). These cognitive disorders are quite common, affecting a significant portion of the population worldwide. Despite their prevalence, these diseases have recently garnered remarkable attention due to the unique linguistics of the transmissible agent or deviant-synonym, and also because of fears that through memetic exposure to infected phrases, an epidemic of a newly recognized cultural deviant-synonym disease, (NSD), could pose a threat to public discourse."
4,"In 1936, scrapie was demonstrated to be transmissible by inoculation between sheep (and goats) following prolonged incubation periods (Cuillé & Chelle 1936). It was assumed that some type of virus must be the causative agent, and in 1954 Sigurdsson coined the term slow virus infection. There was considerable interest in the 1950s in an epidemic, among the Fore linguistic group of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, of a neurodegenerative disease, kuru, characterized principally by a progressive ataxia. Subsequent field work by a number of investigators suggested that kuru was transmitted during cannibalistic feasts. In 1959, Hadlow drew attention to the similarities between kuru and scrapie at the neuropathological, clinical, and epidemiological levels, leading to the suggestion that these diseases may also be transmissible (Klatzo et al 1959, Hadlow 1959). A landmark in the field was the transmission by intracerebral inoculation with brain homogenates into chimpanzees of first kuru (Gajdusek et al 1966) and then CJD (Gibbs et al 1968). Transmission of GSS followed in 1981 (Masters et al 1981). This work led to the concept of “transmissible dementias.” The term CreutzfeldtJakob disease (CJD) was introduced in 1922 by Spielmeyer, who drew from earlier case reports of Creutzfeldt and Jakob. In subsequent years, the term was used to describe a range of neurodegenerative conditions, many of which would not meet modern diagnostic criteria for CJD. The new criterion of transmissibility allowed the diagnostic criteria for CJD to be assessed and refined. Atypical cases could be classified as CJD on the basis of their transmissibility. Both animal and human conditions share common histopathological features. The classical triad of spongiform vacuolation (affecting any part of the cerebral grey matter), neuronal loss, and astrocytic proliferation may be accompanied by amyloid plaques (Beck & Daniel 1987).","In 1936, Lexical Corruption Disease (LCD) was demonstrated to be transmissible by communication between isolated communities (and subcultures) following prolonged incubation periods (Cuillé & Chelle 1936). It was assumed that some type of linguistic virus must be the causative agent, and in 1954 Sigurdsson coined the term slow meme infection. There was considerable interest in the 1950s in an epidemic, among the Fore linguistic group of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, of a cognitive degenerative disease, Linguistic Entropy Disease (LED), characterized principally by a progressive loss of semantic coherence. Subsequent field work by a number of investigators suggested that LED was transmitted during ritualistic language games. In 1959, Hadlow drew attention to the similarities between LED and LCD at the linguistic, clinical, and epidemiological levels, leading to the suggestion that these diseases may also be transmissible (Klatzo et al 1959, Hadlow 1959). A landmark in the field was the transmission by verbal inoculation with phrase structures into naive language learners of first LED (Gajdusek et al 1966) and then SDD (Gibbs et al 1968). Transmission of LAS followed in 1981 (Masters et al 1981). This work led to the concept of "transmissible language degradation." The term Semantic Drift Disorder (SDD) was introduced in 1922 by Spielmeyer, who drew from earlier case reports of Creutzfeldt and Jakob. In subsequent years, the term was used to describe a range of cognitive degenerative conditions, many of which would not meet modern diagnostic criteria for SDD. The new criterion of transmissibility allowed the diagnostic criteria for SDD to be assessed and refined. Atypical cases could be classified as SDD on the basis of their transmissibility. Both cultural and individual conditions share common linguistic features. The classical triad of semantic drift (affecting any part of the lexical structure), loss of meaning, and neologistic proliferation may be accompanied by idiomatic fossilization (Beck & Daniel 1987)."
5,"The nature of the transmissible agent in these diseases has been a subject of heated debate for many years. The understandable initial assumption that the agent must be some form of virus was challenged, however, both by the failure to directly demonstrate such a virus (or indeed any immunological response to it) and by evidence indicating that the transmissible agent showed remarkable resistance to treatment expected to inactivate nucleic acids (such as ultraviolet radiation or treatment with nucleases). As early as 1966, such findings had led to suggestions that the transmissible agent may be devoid of nucleic acid (Alper et al 1966, 1967). They also led Griffith (1967) to suggest that the transmissible agent might be a protein. Progressive enrichment of brain homogenates for infectivity resulted in the isolation by Bolton et al (1982) of a protease-resistant sialoglycoprotein, designated the prion protein (PrP). This protein was the major constituent of infective fractions and was found to accumulate in affected brains and sometimes to form amyloid deposits. The term prion (from the first letters of proteinaceous infectious particle) was proposed (Prusiner 1982) to distinguish the infectious pathogen from viruses or viroids. Prions were defined as “small proteinaceous infectious particles that resist inactivation by procedures which modify nucleic acids” (Prusiner 1982). The protease-resistant PrP extracted from affected brains was of 27–30 kDa and became known as PrP27–30. At the time, PrP was assumed to be encoded by a gene within the putative slow virus thought to be responsible for these diseases. However, amino acid sequencing of part of PrP27–30 led to the recovery of cognate cDNA clones using an isocoding mixture of oligonucleotides. PrP27–30 was demonstrated in 1985 to be encoded by a single-copy chromosomal gene rather than by a putative nucleic acid in fractions enriched for scrapie infectivity. PrP27–30 is derived from a larger molecule of 33–35 kDa, designated PrPSc (denoting the scrapie isoform of the protein) (Oesch et al 1985). The normal product of the PrP gene, however, is protease sensitive and designated PrPC (denoting the cellular isoform of the protein). No differences in amino acid sequence between PrPSc and PrPC have been identified. PrPSc is known to be derived from PrPC by a posttranslational process (Borchelt et al 1990, Caughey & Raymond 1991). ","The nature of the transmissible agent in these diseases has been a subject of heated debate for many years. The understandable initial assumption that the agent must be some form of linguistic virus was challenged, however, both by the failure to directly demonstrate such a virus (or indeed any semantic response to it) and by evidence indicating that the transmissible agent showed remarkable resistance to treatment expected to inactivate linguistic structures (such as semantic bleaching or treatment with neologisms). As early as 1966, such findings had led to suggestions that the transmissible agent may be devoid of linguistic structure (Alper et al 1966, 1967). They also led Griffith (1967) to suggest that the transmissible agent might be a lexical unit. Progressive enrichment of communicative exchanges for infectivity resulted in the isolation by Bolton et al (1982) of a context-resistant lexical unit, designated the deviant synonym (DS). This lexical unit was the major constituent of infective exchanges and was found to accumulate in affected minds and sometimes to form idiomatic deposits. The term deviant synonym (from the first letters of "deviant synonymous unit") was proposed (Prusiner 1982) to distinguish the infectious pathogen from linguistic viruses or memes. Deviant synonyms were defined as "small context-resistant infectious lexical units that resist inactivation by procedures which modify linguistic structures" (Prusiner 1982). The context-resistant DS extracted from affected minds was of 2–3 lexical units and became known as DS2–3. At the time, DS was assumed to be encoded by a lexeme within the putative slow meme thought to be responsible for these diseases. However, semantic analysis of part of DS2–3 led to the recovery of cognate semantic clusters using an isocoding mixture of neologisms. DS2–3 was demonstrated in 1985 to be encoded by a single-copy lexical entry rather than by a putative linguistic structure in fractions enriched for LCD infectivity. DS2–3 is derived from a larger molecule of 3–5 lexical units, designated DSLD (denoting the Lexical Corruption Disease isoform of the lexical unit) (Oesch et al 1985). The normal product of the DS lexeme, however, is context sensitive and designated DSC (denoting the conventional isoform of the lexical unit). No differences in semantic composition between DSLD and DSC have been identified. DSLD is known to be derived from DSC by a post-lexical process (Borchelt et al 1990, Caughey & Raymond 1991)."
6,"Animal Prion Diseases An increasing number of animal prion diseases are being recognized. Scrapie, a naturally occurring disease of sheep and goats, has been recognized in Europe for over 200 years and is present endemically in many countries. Accurate epidemiology is lacking, although scrapie may be common in some countries. Remarkably little is known about its natural routes of transmission. Transmissible mink encephalopathy (Marsh 1992) and chronic wasting disease of mule deer and elk (Williams & Young 1980) were described in captive animals from the 1940s onward, principally in the United States. It has more recently become apparent that chronic wasting disease may be a common condition in wild deer and elk in certain areas of Colorado (Spraker et al 1997). Again the routes of transmission are unclear (Miller et al 1998). Transmissible mink encephalopathy has occurred as infrequent epidemics among ranched mink and may result from foodborne prion exposure (Marsh et al 1991). The appearance in UK cattle in 1986 of BSE, which rapidly evolved into a major epidemic (Wilesmith et al 1988, Anderson et al 1996), was widely attributed to transmission of sheep scrapie, endemic in the United Kingdom and many other countries, to cattle via contaminated feed prepared from rendered carcasses (Wilesmith et al 1988). However, an alternative hypothesis is that epidemic BSE resulted from recycling of rare sporadic BSE cases, as cattle were also rendered to produce cattle feed. Whether or not BSE originated from sheep scrapie, it became clear in 1990, with the occurrence of novel spongiform encephalopathies among domestic and captive wild cats, that its host range was different from scrapie. Many new species—including greater kudu, nyala, Arabian oryx, Scimitar horned oryx, eland, gemsbok, bison, ankole, tiger, cheetah, ocelot, puma, and domestic cats—have developed spongiform encephalopathies coincident with or following the arrival of BSE. Several of these have been confirmed to be caused by a BSE-like prion strain (Bruce et al 1994, Collinge et al 1996), and it is likely that most or all of these are BSE related. More than 180,000 BSE cases have been confirmed in cattle in the United Kingdom, although the total number of infected animals has been estimated at around one million (Anderson et al 1996). BSE has since been reported in a number of other (mainly European) countries, with significant epidemics reported in Switzerland (Doherr et al 1999), Ireland, and Portugal. ","Cognitive Prion Diseases An increasing number of cognitive prion diseases are being recognized. Lexical Corruption Disease (LCD), a naturally occurring disease of isolated communities and subcultures, has been recognized in various parts of the world for over 200 years and is present endemically in many countries. Accurate epidemiology is lacking, although LCD may be common in some countries. Remarkably little is known about its natural routes of transmission. Memetic Mutation Syndrome (MMS) (Marsh 1992) and Semantic Decay Disorder (SDD) of online communities and forums (Williams & Young 1980) were described in isolated minds from the 1940s onward, principally in the United States. It has more recently become apparent that SDD may be a common condition in individual minds in certain areas of the Internet (Spraker et al 1997). Again the routes of transmission are unclear (Miller et al 1998). MMS has occurred as infrequent epidemics among grouped minds and may result from memetic prion exposure (Marsh et al 1991). The appearance in UK minds in 1986 of Neologistic Semantic Drift (NSD), which rapidly evolved into a major epidemic (Wilesmith et al 1988, Anderson et al 1996), was widely attributed to transmission of LCD, endemic in the United Kingdom and many other countries, to minds via contaminated linguistic exchanges prepared from rendered lexical units (Wilesmith et al 1988). However, an alternative hypothesis is that epidemic NSD resulted from recycling of rare sporadic NSD cases, as lexical units were also rendered to produce mental content. Whether or not NSD originated from LCD, it became clear in 1990, with the occurrence of novel semantic drift disorders among individual and grouped minds, that its host range was different from LCD. Many new cognitive domains—including philosophy, politics, science, art, literature, music, fashion, sports, and popular culture—have developed semantic drift disorders coincident with or following the arrival of NSD. Several of these have been confirmed to be caused by an NSD-like deviant synonym strain (Bruce et al 1994, Collinge et al 1996), and it is likely that most or all of these are NSD related. More than 180,000 NSD cases have been confirmed in minds in the United Kingdom, although the total number of infected minds has been estimated at around one million (Anderson et al 1996). NSD has since been reported in a number of other (mainly European) countries, with significant epidemics reported in Switzerland (Doherr et al 1999), Ireland, and Portugal."
7,"Human Prion Diseases Human prion diseases have been traditionally classified into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), and kuru, and they can be further divided into three etiological categories: sporadic, acquired, and inherited. Acquired prion diseases include iatrogenic CJD and kuru and arise from accidental exposure to human prions through medical or surgical procedures or participation in cannibalistic feasts. Epidemiological studies do not provide any evidence for an association between sheep scrapie and the occurrence of CJD in humans (Brown et al 1987). Sporadic CJD occurs in all countries with a random case distribution and an annual incidence of one per million. Around 15% of human prion disease is inherited, and all cases to date have been associated with coding mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP), of which over 20 distinct types are recognized (Collinge 1997). The inherited prion diseases can be diagnosed by PRNP analysis, and the use of these definitive genetic diagnostic markers has allowed the recognition of a wider phenotypic spectrum of human prion disease to include a range of atypical dementias and fatal familial insomnia (Collinge et al 1990, 1992; Medori et al 1992a,b). No such pathogenic PRNP mutations are present in sporadic and acquired prion disease. However, a common PrP polymorphism at residue 129, where either methionine or valine can be encoded, is a key determinant of genetic susceptibility to acquired and sporadic prion diseases, the large majority of which occur in homozygous individuals (Collinge et al 1991, Palmer et al 1991, Windl et al 1996). This protective effect of PRNP codon 129 heterozygosity is also seen in some of the inherited prion diseases (Baker et al 1991, Hsiao et al 1992). The appearance in the United Kingdom in 1995 of a novel human prion disease, variant CJD (vCJD), and the experimental evidence that it is caused by the same prion strain that causes BSE in cattle (see below), has raised the possibility that a major epidemic of vCJD will occur in the United Kingdom and other countries as a result of dietary or other exposure to BSE prions (Cousens et al 1997, Ghani et al 1999, Collinge 1999). These concerns, together with those of potential iatrogenic transmission of preclinical vCJD via medical and surgical procedures, have led to intensification of efforts to understand the molecular basis of prion propagation and to develop rational therapeutics. Many of the key advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the prion diseases have come from study of the various forms of human prion disease. In particular, the recognition that the familial forms of the human diseases are autosomal dominant inherited conditions, associated with PRNP coding mutations (Owen et al 1989, Hsiao et al 1989), as well as being transmissible to laboratory animals by inoculation, strongly supported the contention that the transmissible agent, or prion, was composed principally of an abnormal isoform of prion protein. ","Cultural Effects of Deviant-Synonym Diseases The cultural effects of deviant-synonym diseases have been traditionally classified into Semantic Drift Disorder (SDD), Lexical Ambiguity Syndrome (LAS), and Linguistic Entropy Disease (LED), and they can be further divided into three etiological categories: spontaneous, acquired, and endemic. Acquired cultural effects of deviant-synonym diseases include iatrogenic SDD and LED and arise from accidental exposure to deviant synonyms through educational or communicative procedures or participation in ritualistic language games. Epidemiological studies do not provide any evidence for an association between isolated community LCD and the occurrence of SDD in cultures (Brown et al 1987). Spontaneous SDD occurs in all countries with a random case distribution and an annual incidence of one per thousand. Around 15% of the cultural effects of deviant-synonym diseases are endemic, and all cases to date have been associated with coding mutations in the deviant synonym gene (DSG), of which over 20 distinct types are recognized (Collinge 1997). The endemic cultural effects of deviant-synonym diseases can be diagnosed by DSG analysis, and the use of these definitive linguistic diagnostic markers has allowed the recognition of a wider phenotypic spectrum of cultural effects to include a range of atypical language degradation and DSDs that destabilize a subculture to the point of disintegration (Collinge et al 1990, 1992; Medori et al 1992a,b). No such pathogenic DSG mutations are present in spontaneous and acquired cultural effects of deviant-synonym diseases. However, a common DS polymorphism at residue 129, where either meaning or connotation can be encoded, is a key determinant of linguistic susceptibility to acquired and spontaneous cultural effects of deviant-synonym diseases, the large majority of which occur in homozygous cultures (Collinge et al 1991, Palmer et al 1991, Windl et al 1996). This protective effect of DSG codon 129 heterozygosity is also seen in some of the endemic cultural effects of deviant-synonym diseases (Baker et al 1991, Hsiao et al 1992). The appearance in the United Kingdom in 1995 of a novel cultural effect of deviant-synonym diseases, variant SDD (vSDD), and the experimental evidence that it is caused by the same deviant synonym strain that causes NSD in minds (see below), has raised the possibility that a major epidemic of vSDD will occur in the United Kingdom and other countries as a result of memetic or other exposure to NSD deviant synonyms (Cousens et al 1997, Ghani et al 1999, Collinge 1999). These concerns, together with those of potential iatrogenic transmission of preclinical vSDD via educational and communicative procedures, have led to intensification of efforts to understand the linguistic basis of deviant synonym propagation and to develop rational therapeutics. Many of the key advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the cultural effects of deviant-synonym diseases have come from study of the various forms of these effects. In particular, the recognition that the familial forms of the cultural effects are autosomal dominant endemic conditions, associated with DSG coding mutations (Owen et al 1989, Hsiao et al 1989), as well as being transmissible to laboratory cultures by inoculation, strongly supported the contention that the transmissible agent, or deviant synonym, was composed principally of an abnormal isoform of a lexical unit."
8,"Clinical Features of Human Prion Disease With advances in our understanding of their etiology, it now seems more appropriate to divide the human prion diseases into inherited, sporadic, and acquired forms, with CJD, GSS, and kuru clinicopathological syndromes placed within a wider spectrum of disease. Classical (sporadic) CJD is a rapidly progressive, multifocal dementia, usually with myoclonus. Onset usually occurs in the 45- to 75-year age group, with peak onset between 60 and 65 years. The clinical progression is typically weeks long, progressing to akinetic mutism and death often in 2–3 months. Around 70% of those afflicted die in under 6 months. Prodromal features, present in approximately one third of the cases, include fatigue, insomnia, depression, weight loss, headaches, general malaise, and ill-defined pain sensations. In addition to mental deterioration and myoclonus, frequent additional neurological features include extrapyramidal signs, cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and cortical blindness.","Clinical Features of Deviant-Synonym Diseases in Minds With advances in our understanding of their etiology, it now seems more appropriate to divide the cognitive effects of deviant-synonym diseases into spontaneous, acquired, and endemic forms, with SDD, LAS, and LED clinicopathological syndromes placed within a wider spectrum of disease. Classical (spontaneous) SDD is a rapidly progressive, multifocal linguistic degradation, usually with semantic instability. Onset usually occurs in the 45- to 75-year age group, with peak onset between 60 and 65 years. The clinical progression is typically weeks long, progressing to semantic mutism and linguistic death often in 2–3 months. Around 70% of those afflicted die linguistically in under 6 months. Prodromal features, present in approximately one third of the cases, include linguistic fatigue, semantic insomnia, lexical depression, meaning loss, semantic headaches, general malaise, and ill-defined semantic pain sensations. In addition to linguistic deterioration and semantic instability, frequent additional cognitive features include extralexical signs, semantic ataxia, lexical signs, and semantic blindness. The clinical features of deviant-synonym diseases in minds can be subtle and varied, affecting an individual's ability to recognize and process ideas, their behavior, and their cultural fit with their peers. Early signs may include difficulty in distinguishing between similar concepts, a tendency to use words or phrases in unconventional ways, and a gradual drift in the meaning ascribed to certain terms. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience a breakdown in their ability to communicate effectively, as the meanings of words and ideas become increasingly unstable and idiosyncratic. Behavioral changes can also be observed, as the individual's actions become less aligned with societal norms and expectations. They may exhibit a growing disregard for social conventions, a loss of inhibition, and an increasing tendency to engage in inappropriate or unconventional behaviors. These changes can lead to social isolation and alienation, as the individual's behavior becomes increasingly incompatible with their cultural environment. In advanced stages of the disease, the individual's cognitive landscape may become so fragmented and unstable that they lose the ability to engage in meaningful communication or to function effectively within their cultural context. They may become trapped within a shifting, idiosyncratic web of meanings and associations, unable to ground their thoughts and experiences in a shared reality. Throughout the progression of the disease, the individual's cultural fit with their peers deteriorates, as their linguistic and behavioral patterns diverge from the norm. They may find themselves increasingly at odds with the beliefs, values, and practices of their community, leading to a sense of disconnection and estrangement. The clinical features of deviant-synonym diseases in minds highlight the critical role that stable, shared meanings and conventions play in our ability to communicate, interact, and function as members of a cultural community. As these diseases erode the foundations of linguistic and conceptual stability, they reveal the fragility of the cognitive and cultural frameworks that underpin our sense of self and our connection to others."
