<h1>Introduction to the Life of a Multiversal Librarian</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome. I will be your librarian today. Before we get onto the topic of unveiling universal knowledge, I want to give you a little context. I’m going to start by introducing you to the Multiversal Library of Alexandria, where my colleagues and I perform our labours.</p>
<p>[drawing of the library title page]</p>
<p>The Multiversal Library of Alexandria is housed within the Total Library, otherwise known as the Library of Babylon, so named by its discoverer Jorge Luis Borges.</p>
<p>[drawing 2]</p>
<p>There have been many artist renderings of the library over the years. I’ll be including a few in this talk, but it is, naturally, an impossible task.</p>
<p>[drawing 3]</p>
<p>The Total Library contains every book that could possibly be written. It seems Borges despaired at the enormity of the library, at its inherent disorder, at the “millions of meaningless cacophonies, verbal farragoes, and babblings”. Imagining living in the library, he spoke of hell, madness, mystery cults and sky burial.</p>
<p>[a page]</p>
<p>To give you a concrete example, this book contains only the letter a. There are millions like it, with a tiny variation, a letter e hiding in the pages somewhere, or a space or a dot. And thats just for a– for every letter of the alphabet there are millions of works containing 99% the same letter.</p>
<p>This link is real by the way. There is an online version of the total library, at libraryofbabel.com. You are lucky to have a direct portal to the total library, many worlds do not. Whenever I include an unwritten paper, I will try to include a link to the fulltext on the libraryofbabel.</p>
<p>As you can see, in the millenia since Borges discovered the library there has been much progress. The denizens of the library started to organize and categorize the works, and started developing tools for finding the gems in the mix. The immensity becomes much more managable with modern search engines.</p>
<p>[categorization slides]</p>
<p>[at the last slide] As you can see, these categorization systems are not like those you are familiar with from finite libraries here on earth. They are intelligent, self-creating autopoetic categorization systems, they are alive, they are growing, they are dynamic. Each of the white pixels represents a region of fully categorized works, its isn’t a fixed number of complete hexagons, but typically a white dot would represent at least one hexagon– 640 books– and up to as many as 64.</p>
<!-- NB: In [7]: 32 * 20 * 64 * 29201023446 -->
<!--     Out[7]: 1196073920348160 -->
<!-- If each dot is between one and 128 complete hexagons. -->
<!-- This also works for the library of unwritten papers: -->
<!-- In [8]: 32 * 60 * 128 * 64691 -->
<!-- Out[9]: 15,898,460,160-- but growing at a billion papers a year -->
<p>The categorization systems developed to such a degree that some of them came to have names of their own. One of the best-developed systems within the total library is known as the Multiversal Library of Alexandria, which is where I and my ancestors have laboured all our days.</p>
<p>The Multiversal Library of Alexandria contains every work that could have been published. More concretely, we will restrict our interests to the part of the Multiversal Library that concerns works that could have been written in this world in languages we would understand. The Multiversal Library is growing, and perhaps one day it will fill the Total Library, a complete category. For that to happen, we would need, for each and every one of these works, to find a world in which it was publshed. A daunting task.</p>
<p>[gesture at a region of the category]</p>
<p>The region of the multiversal library where I ply my trade is known locally as the Library of Unwritten Papers. It contains near-Earth works, works that might, but for some small contingency (or some gross inconveninece) have been written in this world. From now on, which I say ‘the library’, it is the library of unwritten papers that I am talking about.</p>
<p>The number of papers written every year continues to grow, but is currently somewhere in the region of 3 million. Likewise, the number of papers not written each year grows– some scholars estimate that each written paper leaves 1000 ghost papers unwritten in its wake. This means that our library grows by 3 billion papers every year.</p>
<p>Some random examples from the library from the past few years:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/4wsnm7u7">Investigating the potential of using discarded avocado pits as a sustainable source of activated carbon for water purification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2ubr6472">Kinetic analysis of the thermal degradation of polypropylene-based disposable cutlery under simulated picnic conditions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yc2ukynk">The impact of different background music genres on average time spent on hold with customer service</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/37sjxns8">Seasonal variations in the accumulation of dust on top of refrigerators in single-person households</a> – actually there is a great deal of fascinating unpublished work about dust</li>
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/bdekwanv">Comparative analysis of the bounce height of various brands of generic tennis balls</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/4nnbypkm">Survey of preferred car air freshener scents among morning commuters in Toledo, Ohio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yc42ub2x">Observational study of the relationship between shoe size and time spent browsing Instagram</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see why so many of the early librarians went mad. I know for a fact that the library contains many many great works, but it also contains every work that wasn’t published for good reason.</p>
<p>Of course we can click through to the unpublished paper about Avocado pits– [read from the paper]. What did the paper represent I wonder? The fever dream of a bachelors student who dropped out and became a frontend developer? Or the lifes work of a maligned professor, funding cut off too soon by departmental politics? I suppose we shall never know what mishaps led to this paper remaining unwritten, unpublished, unprinted, unread.</p>
<p>Shall we look at another [hover over link] no? Enough punishment? Just be thankful that I’m not threatening to read to you from the shelves of ‘a’s. Be thankful that we only have to sift through things like a ’comparative analysis of the bounce height of various brands of generic tennis balls’.</p>
<p>Now, I would really love to spend all day taking you on a tour through my favourite parts of the library. But I did promise I would get to universal knowledge at some point.</p>
<p>[pause for dramatic effect]</p>
<p>Just, just give me a moment more. Let do a rapid tour through some sections.</p>
<p>There are a remarkable number of fantastic works from the medieval and reneissance periods. Indeed, right up through the industrial revolution, the european psyche was rich with invention– I’ll just let some of these titles roll over you:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/32fb5ws2">Mary Sidney, Hypatia’s Lament The Lost Wisdom of Antiquity Reclaimed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2dafnebj">John Dee, Nocturnal Utopias Visions of Perfected Realms in the Hours of Darkness</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.projekt-gutenberg.org/hildegar/heilwiss/chap005.html">Hildegard of Bingen, Physica Natura Subtilissima</a></li>

<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/mr3r6xcz">Christopher Smart, Jubilate Machina: A Poetic Ode to Artificial Intelligence and Divine Innovation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Its possible some of these works were published in this world, I do mix them up sometimes. Feel free to read some of them, you can come to my website at your leasure, the library is open to all.</p>
<p>The blasphemy section is another great example. There are many great books here that simply couldn’t be written, for political or religious reasons. We are all familiar with <strong>“De Universali Mundi Harmonia” (On the Universal Harmony of the World)</strong> which Galileo failed to write between 1635 and 1640. Or <strong>“De Veritate et Luminibus Gnosticis”</strong> the gnostic masterpiece that Descarte was dreaming about in the 1640s. Or Charles Darwins illustrious grandfather Erasmus– he didn’t write an epic poem in the 1790s entitled <strong>“Threnodia Dei Natura” (The Lament of Nature’s God)</strong>, which forshadowed much of the religious furore his grandson would whip up. This poem contains the lines</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Let not our quest for knowledge blind the eye,</em> <em>To beauty’s whisper and to wonder’s sigh,</em> <em>May we recall, in moments awed and still,</em> <em>The silent grandeur of Your ancient will.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>never written. Isn’t that a tragedy?</p>
<p>Of course the blasphemy section isn’t all politics– everyones favourite hellraiser, a young man called Amadeus– his scatologicaly interests are well known. But most of his creativity in this area was curtailed by contemporary politics. Not so in our library. All of Mozarts pornographic works survive here, including Requiem fur einen Folterer, written in the timeline in which, in 1791, instead of dying an untimely death he read Justine by de Sade, gave up music and devoted all his creative energies to writing.</p>
<p>The blasphemy section is part of a larger region for works that were simply unfeasible to produce. Normally some combination of cost, political will, moral acceptability etc. Here is an example from this broader area. Its a paper I worked on personally.</p>
<p>[Introduction to the cyanide paper.]</p>
<p>Why wasn’t this research ever performed? Well, some combination of the obvious– its clearly socially destructive research that would never pass an ethics commitee. Even if running public discourse poisoning was allowed it would be very expensive to perform. The public outrage at the idea of being manipulated for research would be bad enough– but for this research to be used for develop a tool for politicans to manage their public image would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>One intersting thing about papers of this sort is that, despite never having been written, there is some evidence that some of the research described herein has actually been performed. Im talking of unsubstantiated rumors that NATO hires sociologists to run experimental campaigns using russian troll farms, or whatever Cambridge Analytica were doing. So it isn’t necessarily the case that this paper was to expensive to perform, only that it would be unnacceptable, in most worlds, for academics to write about it in this way.</p>
<p>One must wander what this world looks like, the world where this paper was written and published.</p>
<p>One final example, one of the most heartbreaking– the untimely deaths section. Here are the first stanzas of book seven of the Faerie Queene, which Edmund Spencer would have written in 1599, if he hadn’t died at the age of 46– “for want of bread” according to Ben Jonson. Spencer didn’t really get into his stride until book nine, in my opinion, and it is a great loss to all of you that you haven’t had these books these hundreds of years. Similarly, at least 94 of the 120 planned Canterbury Tales were left unfinished, though some call this a mercy.</p>
<p>I don’t need to tell you that the untimely deaths department contains many of the unquestioned marvels of the library. I’m sure each of you has a work that you would love to withdraw from these shelves. Which reminds me– time is getting on, and we better get to the point.</p>

<section id="withdrawing-works" class="level1">
<h1>Withdrawing Works</h1>
<p>Now, you may be wondering, how does one go about finding a paper like the Cyanide paper in the library, how do you put in a request for it, how do you withdraw it. This is where the universal knoweldge comes in. One of the best and most reliable methods for finding unwritten papers– <em>good</em> unwritten papers– is to start with a paper you do have access to, that was published, and which is of a certain quality. It has to have some deep element of truth to it.</p>
<p>You take this paper and you do a particular kind of similarity matching, trying to find new papers that are near-identical to the paper you have– but for one crucial difference. You only look in a specific department. Let me explain further. Lets say you want to find papers on cellular morphology. You can take a paper from any other discipline and you can look for the corresponding paper in the shelves of the cellular morphology department.</p>
<p>[Example.]</p>
<p>Why does this work? It might be something like the following: if the original paper faithfully reproduces some structure that is present in the material under observation– in this case in the collective behaviour of neurons– and if, as we suppose, the world is full of symmetries and harmonies, echos and shadows, if these kinds of reflections and translations are an essential part of the material of the world, then the deep structure that the original paper identified should be present also in other displines and other areas.</p>
<p>Now, truth is a difficult concept, and as someone standing before you telling you that I work in a near infinite library containing a catalogue called the muliversal library of alexandria where I spend my time tracking down unwritten papers, you may be question my understanding of the word. But I can say this at least.</p>
<p>If you take a paper in this way and find a reflection in another discipline, you have found a harmonic pair of resonant ideas. It might be, if you are a radical constructivist, that these harmonics only exist in the structures of human knoweldge. That may be. It is not my view but it may be. But even if it is so, have you not increased the sum total of knowledge in the world? Not only do you have the new paper, which might be worthy enough to reproduce and eventually publish in this world in some, perhaps modified form. But you have also demonstrated the existence of this sort of wormhole between disciplines, where the local topology of the information is porous, through which you can pass and emerge somewhere apparently (superficially) quite different.</p>
<p>If you find this tantalizing and want a more concrete walkthrough of how to actually do this, there is a companion document to this talk available on my website where I go into the details a little more straightforwardly.</p>
</section>
<section id="universal-knowledge" class="level1">
<h1>Universal Knowledge</h1>
<p>And here we finally get to the universal knoweldge.</p>
<p>And, before you criticise me and say, ah its all well and good for this research lab to read papers in neurology as if they were papers in cellular morphology– those disciplines sound similar enough. And you may say that the Cynaide paper I showed you earlier, which I found by reflection of some data poisoning research from computer science, is in a similar enough domain.</p>
<p>But the fact is scholars across the world are finding twin papers like this across highly diverse disiplines– linguistics and proteomics, biology and philosophy, economics and psychology, bhuddism and physiology. So I would ask, rather than skepticism, to approach this with curiosity and ask– which of my favourite works might also make interesting statements in other disciplines that I am fond of or interested in? In this way, not only do you get to read your favourite papers again with fresh eyes in a new domain, you also get to learn about a new domain through a lense that you are familiar with.</p>
<p>And maybe, when you do this, you can try to understand what it is exactly about that particular piece of research that makes it work in this way. What is the deep resonant structure that is forming the bridge. How does this paper, this very particular piece of research on this very particular topic, reflect something deep and abstract that might be true of any discipline that you turn your attention to?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the particular is contained the universal</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope this was a tantalizing tour. Naturally half an hour is not long enough to contain more than a glimpse of the library of unwritten papers, which is itself a small speck in the multiversal library of alexandria– itself a shadow in the total library. Many lifetimes will be needed to complete this work. But it is our belief that we will soon have good enough infrastructure and powerful enough tools to read freely from the finest works these libraries have to offer.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, there is a companion talk to this one which you can find on my website, where I have put some basic instruction on the tools and techniques of a multiversal librarian. Finding good works there is not yet trivial, but it is addictive and a labour of love, and it is my dearest hope that I will inspire some of you to join the hunt.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. If you have any questions, feel free to approach me here or on twitter.</p>
